In the test of railway computer interlocking software carried out, the safety test for a station software last several months, therefore, in order to reduce the test time, it is practical to choose functions from the function set to test through optimization. Software safety test is realized by running testing cases at the cost of labor and time. It is expected to detect dangerous function defects and reduce system loss to gain benefit. Optimization strategy is a best choice to consider testing cases.","1081-7735","0-7695-1951","10.1109/ATS.2003.1250881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250881","","Software safety;Software testing;Linear programming;Software economics;Costs;Optimization methods","safety-critical software;program testing;linear programming;software cost estimation;cost-benefit analysis;optimisation;railway safety","software safety test;safety-critical software;software test cost;station software;test optimization;dangerous function defects;railway interlocking software;linear programming","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key feature of this system is that the problem of test data generation is treated entirely as a numerical optimization problem and, as a consequence, this method does not suffer from the difficulties commonly found in symbolic execution systems, such as those associated with input variable-dependent loops, array references and module calls. Instead, program instrumentation is used to solve a set of path constraints without explicitly knowing their form. The system supports not only the generation of integer and real data types, but also non-numerical discrete types such as characters and enumerated types.

With prioritization, the rate of fault detection is improved, thus allowing testers to detect faults earlier in the system-testing phase. Most of the prioritization techniques to date have been code coverage-based. These techniques may treat all faults equally. We build upon prior test case prioritization research with two main goals: (1) to improve user-perceived software quality in a cost effective way by considering potential defect severity and (2) to improve the rate of detection of severe faults during system-level testing of new code and regression testing of existing code. We present a value-driven approach to system-level test case prioritization called the prioritization of requirements for test (PORT). PORT prioritizes system test cases based upon four factors: requirements volatility, customer priority, implementation complexity, and fault proneness of the requirements. We conducted a PORT case study on four projects developed by students in advanced graduate software testing class. Our results show that PORT prioritization at the system level improves the rate of detection of severe faults. Additionally, customer priority was shown to be one of the most important prioritization factors contributing to the improved rate of fault detection.","","0-7803-9507","10.1109/ISESE.2005.1541815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541815","","System testing;Computer aided software engineering;Software testing;Fault detection;Software quality;Costs;Software engineering;Computer science;Statistical analysis;Phase detection","program testing;software quality;software fault tolerance;regression analysis","system-level test case prioritization;regression test case;fault detection;code coverage-based prioritization technique;software quality;software defect severity;value-driven approach;prioritization of requirements for test;PORT;requirements volatility;customer priority;implementation complexity;fault proneness;software testing","","46","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both have many common needs; both are critical to the design and development of our products. Validating the state of a device or product has become all but impossible, without direct access to the internal state of the device. Scan based diagnostic techniques are now being used at the board, system and software debug and development stages of product development cycles; these are the same requirements that device test has always had. The implication is to enable the use of on-chip test structures and features for more than just the manufacturing process. As these on-chip features become more prevalent, their standardization and proliferation will be the norm rather than the exception. As such, advancements in diagnostics and built-in self verifying (and testing) devices and products, can and will become the dominant strategy optimizing time to market of our products, ultimately allowing our customers to becomes more successful.","1089-3539","0-7803-2992","10.1109/TEST.1995.529933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=529933","","Logic testing;Software debugging;Software systems;Product development;Software testing;System testing;Manufacturing processes;Standardization;Automatic testing;Time to market","integrated circuit testing;automatic testing;design for testability;logic testing;built-in self test;standardisation;production testing","deep-submicron test;functional verification;logical defects;physical defects;scan based diagnostic techniques;software debugging;product development;on-chip test structures;standardization;built-in self verifying;diagnostics;time to market","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Test prioritization tries to order test cases for execution so the chances of early detection of faults during retesting are increased. The existing prioritization methods are based on the code of the system. System modeling is a widely used technique to model state-based systems. In this paper, we present methods of test prioritization based on state-based models after changes to the model and the system. The model is executed for the test suite and information about model execution is used to prioritize tests. Execution of the model is inexpensive as compared to execution of the system; therefore the overhead associated with test prioritization is relatively small. In addition, we present an analytical framework for evaluation of test prioritization methods. This framework may reduce the cost of evaluation as compared to the existing evaluation framework that is based on experimentation (observation).

The failure rate of components used to build the applications are related to the testing cost through various types of reliability growth curves. We achieve closed-form solutions to problems where there is one single application in the system. Analytical solutions are not readily available when there are multiple applications; however, numerical solutions can be obtained using a nonlinear programming tool.

One reason for this expense is the Federal Aviation Administration's requirement that test suites be modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) adequate. Despite its cost, there is evidence that MC/DC is an effective verification technique, and can help to uncover safety faults. As the software is modified and new test cases are added to the test suite, the test suite grows, and the cost of regression testing increases. To address the test-suite size problem, researchers have investigated the use of test-suite reduction algorithms, which identify a reduced test suite that provides the same coverage of the software, according to some criterion, as the original test suite, and test-suite prioritization algorithms, which identify an ordering of the test cases in the test suite according to some criteria or goals. Existing test-suite reduction and prioritization techniques, however, may not be effective in reducing or prioritizing MC/DC-adequate test suites because they do not consider the complexity of the criterion. The paper presents new algorithms for test-suite reduction and prioritization that can be tailored effectively for use with MC/DC.

However, if the test suite takes a long time to produce feedback, the developer is slowed down, and the benefit of frequent testing is reduced. After a program is edited, ideally, only changed code would be tested. Any time spent executing previously tested, unchanged parts of the code is wasted. For a large test suite containing many small unit tests, test selection and prioritization can be effective. Test selection runs only those tests that are possibly affected by the most recent change, and test prioritization can run first the tests that are most likely to reveal a recently-introduced error.","0270-5257;1558-1225","1-59593-963","10.1109/ICSE.2005.1553636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553636","","Automatic testing;System testing;Software testing;Computer bugs;Costs;Instruments;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Debugging;Algorithm design and analysis","software maintenance;program testing","test factoring;software maintenance;regression error;unit testing;test selection;test prioritization;mock object","","1","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An equally critical component of the benchmarking process is the proper selection of benchmark circuits. This issue is also applicable to research projects where there is more opportunity to use outdated and unrealistic circuits. The problems of testability can never be solved by throwing circuits at the test tools being evaluated. Testability can be achieved only through trade-offs. Furthermore, during the entire evaluation period, continual interaction with the vendor is critical to insure that benchmark experiments are performed with the right conditions and constraints on the tool.

To improve it, regression test selection (RTS) techniques strive to lower costs without overly reducing effectiveness by carefully selecting a subset of the test suite. Under certain conditions, some can even guarantee that the selected test cases perform no worse than the original test suite. This ignores certain software development realities such as resource and time constraints that may prevent using RTS techniques as intended (e.g., regression testing must be done overnight, but RTS selection returns two days worth of tests). In practice, testers work around this by prioritizing the test cases and running only those that fit within existing constraints. Unfortunately this generally violates key RTS assumptions, voiding RTS technique guarantees and making regression testing performance unpredictable. Despite this, existing prioritization techniques are memoryless, implicitly assuming that local choices can ensure adequate long run performance. Instead, we propose a new technique that bases prioritization on historical execution data. We conducted an experiment to assess its effects on the long run performance of resource constrained regression testing. Our results expose essential tradeoffs that should be considered when using these techniques over a series of software releases.","","1-58113-472","10.1109/ICSE.2002.1007961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1007961","","Software testing;Time factors;Educational institutions;Permission;System testing;Computer science;Software maintenance;Costs;Performance evaluation;Programming","program testing;software maintenance;program verification","history-based test prioritization;regression testing;resource constrained environments;software maintenance;modified software revalidation;costs;performance;experiment;software releases;program testing","","28","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a commonly used cost model is extended to the case of imperfect debugging. Based on this, the effect of imperfect debugging is studied. As the probability of perfect debugging, termed testing level here, is expensive to be increased, but manageable to a certain extent with additional resources, a model incorporating this situation is presented.

In view of strong empirical evidence of positive failure correlations between program versions, it is desirable to generalize these reliability optimization techniques by taking such correlations explicitly into consideration. In the presented paper, this is done based on a multiversion software failure correlation model tracing back to D.E Eckhardt and L.D. Lee (1985). We show how taking failure correlation into account extends the corresponding optimization problems, and how they can be treated computationally. In particular, in the (practically relevant) case of components with relatively high reliability, the optimization problems reduce to knapsack type problems which can, for relevant problem sizes, be solved with rather low computational effort.

At the minimum cost point, the cost of an infinitesimal increment of testing equals the marginal benefit to be gained from the increment. The model can also be used to estimate the cost of testing software if the release data is determined by some other criteria, such as reliability. Since the cost of testing software depends on the pattern of failures, the model is based on underlying software reliability models. The cost model is explicitly developed so as to apply to a wide class of reliability models. It is noted that special cases result from choosing specific models, for example, the Goel-Okumoto nonhomogeneous Poisson process model, in which all bugs have an equal impact on the failure rate, and the Musa-Okumoto logarithmic Poisson process model, in which bugs found earlier have a larger impact.<<ETX>>","","0-87942-661","10.1109/ARMS.1991.154473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=154473","","Software testing;Software reliability;Computer bugs;Context modeling;Software systems;Software debugging;Cost function;Software quality;Software development management;System testing","economics;failure analysis;optimisation;program testing;software reliability","software reliability;management;optimisation;testing;quantitative cost model;failures;Goel-Okumoto nonhomogeneous Poisson process;bugs;Musa-Okumoto logarithmic Poisson process","","","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One reason for this expense is the Federal Aviation Administration's requirement that test suites be modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) adequate. Despite its cost, there is evidence that MC/DC is an effective verification technique and can help to uncover safety faults. As the software is modified and new test cases are added to the test suite, the test suite grows and the cost of regression testing increases. To address the test-suite size problem, researchers have investigated the use of test-suite reduction algorithms, which identify a reduced test suite that provides the same coverage of the software according to some criterion as the original test suite, and test-suite prioritization algorithms, which identify an ordering of the test cases in the test suite according to some criteria or goals. Existing test-suite reduction and prioritization techniques, however, may not be effective in reducing or prioritizing MC/DC-adequate test suites because they do not consider the complexity of the criterion. This paper presents new algorithms for test-suite reduction and prioritization that can be tailored effectively for use with MC/DC.

The fundamental idea is to relate testing time to predicted risk level of the modules in the release under test.

One potential goal of such prioritization is to increase a test suite's rate of fault detection. Previous work reported results of studies that showed that prioritization techniques can significantly improve rate of fault detection. Those studies, however, raised several additional questions: 1) Can prioritization techniques be effective when targeted at specific modified versions; 2) what trade-offs exist between fine granularity and coarse granularity prioritization techniques; 3) can the incorporation of measures of fault proneness into prioritization techniques improve their effectiveness? To address these questions, we have performed several new studies in which we empirically compared prioritization techniques using both controlled experiments and case studies.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.988497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988497","","Computer aided software engineering;Fault detection;Software testing;System testing;Costs;Software measurement;Radio access networks;Feedback;Debugging;Instruments","program testing","test case prioritization;regression testing;software testing;fault detection rate;fine granularity prioritization techniques;coarse granularity prioritization techniques;fault proneness measures","","364","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We detail how we were able to take advantage of LabVIEW's instrument control capabilities to optimize our VXI data acquisition process. We then discuss how LabVIEW can be used not only as an instrument control language, but also as a general purpose programming language. We discuss how we used LabVIEW for test program set (TPS) development and for rapidly prototyping user interfaces and program features for immediate operator/customer feedback.

To ensure the overall reliability of an integrated software system, its software components have to meet certain reliability requirements, subject to some testing schedule and resource constraints. Efficiency improvement of the system-testing can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem with known cost, reliability, effort and other attributes of the system components. This paper considers ""software component testing resource allocation"" for a system with single or multiple applications, each with a pre-specified reliability requirement. The relation between failure rates of components and ""cost to decrease this rate"" is modeled by various types of reliability-growth curves. Closed-form solutions to the problem for systems with one single application are developed, and then ""how to solve the multiple application problem using nonlinear programming techniques"" are described. Also examined are the interactions between the system components, and inter-component failure dependencies are included in the modeling formula. In addition to regular systems, the technique is extended to address fault-tolerant systems. A procedure for a systematic approach to the testing resource allocation problem is developed, and its application in a case study of a telecommunications software system is described. This procedure is automated in a reliability allocation tool for an easy specification of the problem and an automatic application of the technique. This methodology gives the basic approach to optimization of testing schedules, subject to reliability constraints. This adds ""interesting new optimization opportunities in the software testing phase"" to the existing optimization literature that is concerned with structural optimization of the software architecture. Merging these two approaches improves the reliability planning accuracy in component-based software development.","0018-9529;1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.1011524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011524","","Resource management;Software testing;Software reliability;Software systems;Application software;System testing;Programming;Cost function;Closed-form solution;Fault tolerant systems","telecommunication computing;software reliability;program testing;nonlinear programming;combinatorial mathematics;fault tolerant computing","component-based software development approach;software reliability growth modeling;test resources allocation optimisation;integrated software system reliability;combinatorial optimization problem;component failure rates;reliability-growth curves;nonlinear programming;inter-component failure dependencies;telecommunications software system;reliability allocation tool;testing schedules optimization;reliability planning accuracy","","46","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We exploit a combined pointer and escape analysis that is able to identify how individual objects allocated in one region of a program interact with other regions of a program. The analysis framework increases flexibility and scalability as testing coverage can be targeted to a specific arbitrary region of a program, followed by integration testing that can be focused on particular sets of objects escaping the region.

Simultaneously, the lifetime of software systems becomes very small and thus their development is required within a relatively short period. We propose a novel selective software testing method that aims to attain the requirement of short period development. The proposed method consists of 3 steps: assign priorities to functional modules (Step 1), derive a test specification (Step 2), and construct a test plan (Step 3) according to the priorities. In Step 1, for development of functional modules, we select both product and process properties to calculate priorities. Then, in Step 2, we generate detailed test items for each module according to its priority. Finally, in Step 3, we manage test resources including time and developer's skill to attain the requirement. As a result of experimental application, we can show the superiority of the proposed testing method compared to the conventional testing method.","","0-7695-1287","10.1109/APAQS.2001.990028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990028","","Software testing;System testing;Embedded software;Software systems;Fault detection;Application software;Programming;Research and development;Systems engineering and theory;Resource management","program testing;formal specification;resource allocation","selective software testing method;functional modules;priority assignment;software systems lifetime;short period development;test specification;test plan;process properties;product properties;test resources;design of testing specification","","2","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Empirical results show that pairwise testing is practical and effective for various types of software systems. We show that the problem of generating a minimum test set for pairwise testing is NP-complete. We propose a test generation strategy, called in-parameter-order (or IPO), for pairwise testing. For a system with two or more input parameters, the IPO strategy generates a pairwise test set for the first two parameters, extends the test set to generate a pairwise test set for the first three parameters, and continues to do so for each additional parameter. The IPO strategy allows the use of local optimization techniques for test generation and the reuse of existing tests when a system is extended with new parameters or new values of existing parameters. We present practical, IPO-based test generation algorithms. We describe the implementation of an IPO-based test generation tool and show some empirical results.","","0-8186-9221","10.1109/HASE.1998.731623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=731623","","System testing;Computer science;Reactive power;Independent component analysis;Software testing;Software systems","program testing;optimisation;computational complexity","in-parameter-order;test generation strategy;pairwise testing;specification-based testing;software testing;NP-complete;IPO strategy;local optimization;test generation tool","","70","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To find these inputs by hand is extremely time-consuming, especially when the software is complex. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to automate the process. Random test data generation consists of generating test inputs at random, in the hope that they will exercise the desired software features. Often, the desired inputs must satisfy complex constraints, and this makes a random approach seem unlikely to succeed. In contrast, combinatorial optimization techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms, are meant to solve difficult problems involving the simultaneous satisfaction of many constraints. In this paper, we discuss experiments with a test generation problem that is harder than the ones discussed in earlier literature-we use a larger program and more complex test adequacy criteria. We find a widening gap between a technique based on genetic algorithms and those based on random test generation.","","0-8186-7961","10.1109/ASE.1997.632858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=632858","","Genetic algorithms;Software testing;Performance evaluation;Benchmark testing;Fuzzy logic;Automatic control;Constraint optimization;Automatic testing;Materials testing;Minimization methods","genetic algorithms;program testing","software testing;test data generation;program features;combinatorial optimization;test generation;test adequacy criteria;genetic algorithms;random test generation","","33","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A faster fault detection rate during regression testing provides earlier feedback on a system under test, supporting earlier strategic decisions about release schedules and letting engineers begin debugging sooner.

To reduce this expense, software testers may prioritize their test cases so that those that are more important are run earlier in the regression testing process. Previous work has shown that prioritization can improve a test suite's rate of fault detection, but the assessment of prioritization techniques has been limited to hand-seeded faults, primarily due to the belief that such faults are more realistic than automatically generated (mutation) faults. A recent empirical study, however, suggests that mutation faults can be representative of real faults. We have therefore designed and performed a controlled experiment to assess the ability of prioritization techniques to improve the rate of fault detection techniques, measured relative to mutation faults. Our results show that prioritization can be effective relative to the faults considered, and they expose ways in which that effectiveness can vary with characteristics of faults and test suites.

A covering array, CA(N; t, k, v), is an N/spl times/k array on v symbols such that every N x t sub-array contains all ordered subsets from v symbols of size t at least once. The properties of these objects, however do not necessarily satisfy real software testing needs. Instead we examine a less studied object, the mixed level covering array and propose a new object, the variable strength covering array, which provides a more robust environment for software interaction testing.

The effectiveness of such multi-technique approaches depends upon a quite subtle interplay between their individual efficacies. The modeling tool we use to study this problem is closely related to earlier work on software design diversity which showed that it would be unreasonable even to expect software versions that were developed truly independently to fail independently of one another. The key idea was a ""difficulty function"" over the input space. Later work extended these ideas to introduce a notion of ""forced"" diversity. In this paper, we show that many of these results for design diversity have counterparts in diverse fault detection in a single software version. We define measures of fault-finding effectiveness and diversity, and show how these might be used to give guidance for the optimal application of different fault-finding procedures to a particular program. The effects on reliability of repeated applications of a particular fault-finding procedure are not statistically independent; such an incorrect assumption of independence will always give results that are too optimistic. For diverse fault-finding procedures, it is possible for effectiveness to be even greater than it would be under an assumption of statistical independence. Diversity of fault-finding procedures is a good thing and should be applied as widely as possible. The model is illustrated using some data from an experimental investigation into diverse fault-finding on a railway signalling application.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.888629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888629","","Diversity reception;Fault detection;Software design;Application software;Redundancy;Hardware;Aerospace control;Battery powered vehicles;Software engineering;Particle measurements","system recovery;program diagnostics;software reliability;signalling;railways","software fault detection techniques;multi-technique approach;modeling tool;software design diversity;independently developed software versions;system failure;difficulty function;forced diversity;fault-finding effectiveness;repeated application reliability;diverse fault-finding procedures;statistical independence;railway signalling application;fault removal;software testing;software reliability growth","","20","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In contrast to the vectorless testing concept which assumes nothing about the circuit card, our implementation would contain a circuit topology and a designation of devices in the circuit, including standard designation input devices, output devices, voltage and current sources, etc. A library interface is supplied to specify (when required) the safe ranges of stimulation, signal sources and analog waveforms, probe paths and if desired, an operating range and quantization of a device. As opposed to passive testing, this technique allows the tester to jump into the operating range of the device. Stimulation pattern effectiveness is measured in terms of output entropy. While the initial stimulation pattern may be selected at random, directed search techniques allow the optimization of the stimulation by eliminating redundancy, and changing existing patterns toward a stimulation pattern of increased entropy. A digital application of this concept is being developed for the Electronic Work Bench (EWB), a new VXI system using components from Talon. While a fully automatic process is not always practical, this concept should make considerable headway toward reducing to human labor cost while improving the overall process.","1088-7725","0-7803-3379","10.1109/AUTEST.1996.547690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=547690","","Design for experiments;Automatic test equipment;Circuit testing;Entropy;Electronic circuits;Circuit topology;Voltage;Libraries;Probes;Quantization","automatic test software;printed circuit testing;fault diagnosis;entropy;peripheral interfaces;software engineering;network topology;infrared imaging","Electronic Work Bench;automatic test equipment software;electronic circuit card;universal diagnostic capability;stimulation patterns;VXI;circuit topology;Talon;current sources;voltage sources;library interface;signal sources;analog waveforms;probe paths;labor cost;output entropy;directed search techniques;optimization;redundancy","","","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number of failures observed is used to bound the failure probability even if the number of failures observed is zero. Typical analyses assume that all failures that occur are observed, but, in practice, failures occur without being observed. In this paper, we examine the effect of imperfect error detection, i.e. the situation in which a failure of the software may not be observed. If a conventional analysis associated with life testing is used, the confidence in the bound on the failure probability is optimistic. Our results show that imperfect error detection does not necessarily limit the ability of life testing to bound the probability of failure to the very low values required in critical systems. However, we show that the confidence level associated with a bound on failure probability cannot necessarily be made as high as desired, unless very strong assumptions are made about the error detection mechanism. Such assumptions are unlikely to be met in practice, and so life testing is likely to be useful only for situations in which very high confidence levels are not required.<<ETX>>","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.265635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=265635","","Life testing;Software testing;Failure analysis;Life estimation;Software reliability;Hardware;Software measurement;Predictive models;NASA;Software systems","software reliability;error detection;life testing;probability","imperfect error detection;software reliability assessment;life testing;test cases;failure probability;unobserved failures;test oracles;critical systems;confidence level;software testing","","20","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper argues that you can significantly improve the results of software quality testing by optimizing the test duration. This involves varying the rate of the above two factors (resources and TTSR) and using the appropriate failure intensity models. This paper, based on hands-on experience, presents a methodology for planning the trade-off between resources and TTSR by controlling testing phase duration. In the process, we attempt to define the most typical pitfalls in planning testing phase duration, i.e. TTSR, and offer some practical recommendations on how to avoid these pitfalls.

The paper analyzes the behavior of the corresponding optimal test profile determined by the CMC approach to software testing.

Black-box program outputs have been used to characterize program behaviors and they are compared over program versions in traditional regression testing. Program spectra have recently been proposed to characterize a program's behavior inside the black box. Comparing program spectra of program versions offers insights into the internal behavioral differences between versions. In this paper, we present a new class of program spectra, value spectra, that enriches the existing program spectra family. We compare the value spectra of a program's old version and new version to detect internal behavioral deviations in the new version. We use a deviation-propagation call tree to present the deviation details. Based on the deviation-propagation call tree, we propose two heuristics to locate deviation roots, which are program locations that trigger the behavioral deviations. We also use path spectra (previously proposed program spectra) to approximate the program states in value spectra. We then similarly compare path spectra to detect behavioral deviations and locate deviation roots in the new version. We have conducted an experiment on eight C programs to evaluate our spectra-comparison approach. The results show that both value-spectra-comparison and path-spectra-comparison approaches can effectively expose program behavioral differences between program versions even when their program outputs are the same, and our value-spectra-comparison approach reports deviation roots with high accuracy for most programs.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2005.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542068","Index Terms- Program spectra;regression testing;software testing;empirical studies;software maintenance.","Software testing;Software maintenance;Fault diagnosis;Propagation losses;Program processors;Optimizing compilers","program testing;software maintenance;formal verification;regression analysis","regression testing;program version;software maintenance;black-box program;program behavior;program spectra;deviation-propagation call tree;C program;value-spectra-comparison;path-spectra-comparison","","23","36","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These techniques were compared with data sets obtained from three large subject programs: the GCC, Jikes, and javac compilers. The results indicate that distribution-based techniques can be as efficient or more efficient for revealing defects than coverage-based techniques, but that the two kinds of techniques are also complementary in the sense that they find different defects.

However, missing or incomplete data often appear in the data samples used to construct the model. So far, the least biased and thus the most recommended software metric models for dealing with the missing/incomplete data are those constructed by using the maximum likelihood methods. It is true that the inclusion of a particular predictor metric in the model construction is initially based on an intuitive or experience-based assumption that the predictor metric impacts significantly the target metric. Nevertheless, this assumption has to be verified. Previous research on metric models constructed by using the maximum likelihood methods simply took this verification for granted. This can result in probable inclusion of superfluous predictor metric(s) and/or unnecessary predictor metric complexity. In this paper, we propose a methodology to optimize and simplify such models based on the results of appropriate hypothesis tests. An experiment is also reported to demonstrate the use of our methodology in trimming redundant predictor metric(s) and/or unnecessary predictor metric complexity.","0730-3157;0730-3157","0-7695-2413","10.1109/COMPSAC.2005.116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509998","software metrics;modeling;maximum likelihood method","Optimization methods;Software metrics;Predictive models;Software systems;Testing;Software measurement;Terminology;Statistical analysis;Least squares methods;Least squares approximation","software metrics;maximum likelihood estimation;software development management;optimisation","software metric model optimization;software metric model simplification;maximum likelihood method;development work effort;software system;project predictor metrics;project team size;predictor metric complexit","","3","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Agile development: evaluation and experience","W. F. Tichy","Karlsruhe Univ., Germany","Proceedings. 26th International Conference on Software Engineering","","2004","","","692","","Agile methods such as Extreme Programming, Crystal, Scrum, and others have attracted a lot of attention recently. Agile methods stress early and continuous delivery of software, welcome changing requirements, and value early feedback from customers. Agile methods seek to cut out inefficiency, bureaucracy, and anything that adds no value to a software product. Proponents of agile methods often see software specification and documentation as adding no value, which has led observers to conclude that agile development is nothing but unprincipled hacking, perhaps even an anarchic counter-reaction to bureaucratic, heavyweight software processes that demand ever more intermediate deliverables from developers. The purpose of this panel is to discuss under what circumstances agile methods work and don't work. Some of the key practices of agile methods are: scheduling according to feature priorities, incremental delivery of software, feedback from expert users, emphasis on face-to-face communication, pair development, minimalist design combined with refactoring, test-driven development, automated regression testing, daily integration, self-organizing teams, and periodic tuning of the methods. Working software is the primary measure of success. Find out what the latest practical experience with agile methods is and learn about the latest thinking in this area.","0270-5257","0-7695-2163","10.1109/ICSE.2004.1317492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317492","","Feedback;Automatic testing;Software testing;Stress;Documentation;Computer crime;Tuning;Software measurement;Software engineering","software engineering;program testing","agile development;Extreme Programming;Crystal;Scrum;software specification;program documentation;scheduling;software incremental delivery;face-to-face communication;test-driven development;automated regression testing","","2","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By bringing in key physical functions into the front-end of the DFT/physical synthesis flow, the designer is able to successfully meet all design and testability goals, with minimum impact on timing closure. In this paper, we present a DFT synthesis flow tightly integrated within physical synthesis to achieve physically optimized scan designs.

Therefore, one needs to be able to differentiate low/high fault density components so that testing/verification effort can be concentrated where needed. Such a strategy is ejected to detect more faults and thus improve the resulting reliability of the overall system. The authors present an alternative approach for constructing such models that is intended to fulfil specific software engineering needs, (i.e. dealing with partial/incomplete information and creating models that are easy to interpret). The approach to classification is to: measure the software system to be considered; and to build multivariate stochastic models for prediction. The authors present experimental results obtained by classifying FORTRAN components into two fault density classes: low and high.

"Open systems architecture solutions for military avionics testing","S. Pizzica","Raytheon Co., El Segundo, CA, USA","IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","","2001","16","8","4","9","Raytheon makes extensive use of open systems architecture methods in developing special test equipment (STE) for testing military avionics equipment. Such use has resulted in significant cost and schedule savings in the development of production test equipment for radar and infrared systems. With open systems architectures, a test system can be assembled using COTS products. This brings economies of scale to test equipment, which is normally built in very low quantities. Therefore, the potential cost savings due to COTS usage is proportionately greater in STE than in the higher volume avionics systems that are tested. A second major benefit of using COTS products is that test system development schedule cycle time is greatly reduced. This paper describes the application of Open Systems Architectures (OSA) to avionics testing. The following major architectures are surveyed: VME bus, VXI bus, IEEE GPIB, IEEE 1149.1 JTAG test bus, 1553 Military Bus, Fibre Channel, and COTS Test Applications Software. We describe how the benefits of OSA have been extended at Raytheon into achieving vertical test commonalities. The flexibility of OSA can be exploited to provide an overall optimum test solution, taking all levels of test into account. For example, test systems can be tailored with COTS products to provide integrated methods for avionics tests at the module, unit, and system levels. Test systems can be configured to maximize the reuse of COTS hardware over all test levels. Test software can also be programmed to optimize such reuse over levels of test. Additional test verticality synergies derived from such OSA usage are described, including: test false alarm avoidance; test cones of tolerance optimization; and efficient test of field returns.","0885-8985;1557-959X","","10.1109/62.942212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942212","","Open systems;Aerospace electronics;System testing;Software testing;Test equipment;Costs;Application software;Computer architecture;Military equipment;Production systems","military avionics;automatic test equipment;automatic test software;boundary scan testing;open systems;peripheral interfaces;system buses;military standards","military avionics testing;open systems architecture;special test equipment;cost and schedule savings;production test equipment;COTS products;system development schedule cycle time;VME bus;VXI bus;IEEE GPIB;1553 Military Bus;Fibre Channel;COTS Test Applications Software;IEEE 1149.1 JTAG test bus","","4","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Modern software systems must have high reliability. Software quality models are tools for guiding reliability enhancement activities to high risk modules for maximum effectiveness and efficiency. A software quality model predicts a quality factor, such as the number of faults in a module, early in the life cycle in time for effective action. Software product and process metrics can be the basis for such fault predictions. Moreover, classification models can identify fault prone modules. CBR is an attractive modeling method based on automated reasoning processes. However, to our knowledge, few CBR systems for software quality modeling have been developed. SMART addresses this area. There are currently three types of models supported by SMART: classification based on CBR, CBR classification extended with cluster analysis, and module-order models, which predict the rank-order of modules according to a quality factor. An empirical case study of a military command, control, and communications applied SMART at the end of coding. The models built by SMART had a level of accuracy that could be very useful to software developers.","1082-3409","0-7695-0909","10.1109/TAI.2000.889846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=889846","","Software quality;Software measurement;Predictive models;Q factor;Fault diagnosis;Software reliability;Automatic testing;System testing;Software systems;Military communication","software quality;software metrics;software performance evaluation;software reliability;case-based reasoning;command and control systems;software tools","software quality modeling;Software Measurement Analysis and Reliability Toolkit;SMART;research tool;case based reasoning;software quality models;reliability enhancement activities;high risk modules;quality factor;life cycle;software product;process metrics;fault predictions;classification models;fault prone modules;automated reasoning processes;CBR systems;CBR classification;cluster analysis;module-order models;rank-order;military command control and communications;software developers","","4","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In statistical testing of software based on a Markov chain usage model, the rich body of analytical results available for Markov chains provides numerous insights that can be used in test planning. Further, the connection between Markov chains and operations research techniques permits a Markov usage model to be expressed as a system of constraints, with mathematical programming used to generate the optimal model for a particular objective function. Since a software usage model is based on the specification, all analyses may be performed early in the development cycle and used as a quantitative basis for management decisions. These techniques have been reduced to engineering practice and used in large projects by IBM, Ericsson, all branches of the US military, and others. In this paper, statistical experiments, Markov models, and optimization techniques are shown to provide a sound theoretical and practical basis far quantifying the reliability of software.","1082-3670","0-8186-7137","10.1109/SESS.1995.525966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=525966","","Statistical analysis;Mathematical model;Software systems;Software testing;Operations research;Mathematical programming;Software performance;Performance analysis;Software development management;Acoustical engineering","software reliability;program testing;Markov processes;mathematical programming;formal specification;certification","software reliability;statistical testing;usage model;Markov chain usage model;operations research;mathematical programming;objective function;software usage model;specification;development cycle;management decisions","","7","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because engineers add tests into test suites as software evolves, over time, increased test suite size makes revalidation of the software more expensive. Regression test selection, test suite reduction, and test case prioritization techniques can help with this, by reducing the number of regression tests that must be run and by helping testers meet testing objectives more quickly. These techniques, however can be expensive to employ and may not reduce overall regression testing costs. Thus, practitioners and researchers could benefit from cost models that would help them assess the cost-benefits of techniques. Cost models have been proposed for this purpose, but some of these models omit important factors, and others cannot truly evaluate cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we present new cost-benefits models for regression test selection, test suite reduction, and test case prioritization, that capture previously omitted factors, and support cost-benefits analyses where they were not supported before.

Our studies showed that the rate of fault detection of test suites could be significantly improved by using more powerful prioritization techniques. In addition, they indicated that rate of fault detection was closely associated with the target program. We also observed a large quantity of unexplained variance, indicating that other factors must be affecting prioritization effectiveness. These observations motivate the following research questions. (1) Are there factors other than the target program and the prioritization technique that consistently affect the rate of fault detection of test suites? (2) What metrics are most representative of each factor? (3) Can the consideration of additional factors lead to more efficient prioritization techniques?

According to this tendency, software testing becomes more difficult than before and cost of testing increases so much, since many test items are required. In this paper we propose and discuss such a new selective software testing method that is constructed from previous testing method by simplifying testing specification. We have presented, in the previous work, a selective testing method to perform highly efficient software testing. The selective testing method has introduced an idea of functional priority testing and generated test items according to their functional priorities. Important functions with high priorities are tested in detail, and functions with low priorities are tested less intensively. As a result, additional cost for generating testing instructions becomes relatively high. In this paper in order to reduce its cost, we change the way of giving information, with respect to priorities. The new method gives the priority only rather than generating testing instructions to each test item, which makes the testing method quite simple and results in cost reduction. Except for this change, the new method is essentially the same as the previous method. We applied this new method to actual development of software tool and evaluated its effectiveness. From the result of the application experiment, we confirmed that many crucial faults can be detected by using the proposed method.","","0-7695-1796","10.1109/ISESE.2002.1166937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166937","","Software testing;Costs;Performance evaluation;System testing;Application software;Software quality;Research and development;Systems engineering and theory;Information science;Fault detection","program testing;software fault tolerance","crucial faults elimination;selective testing method;software systems;software testing;testing specification;functional priority testing","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We looked at genetic algorithms to solve this problem and modeled it as follows: a test case can be considered as a predator while a mutant program is analogous to a prey. The aim of the selection process is to generate test cases able to kill as many mutants as possible. To overcome disappointing experimentation results on the studied .NET system, we propose a slight variation on this idea, no longer at the ""animal"" level (lions killing zebras) but at the bacteriological level.

DFT (design for test) software tools that enable testability analysis during board design allow test engineers to work concurrently with designers. Case study results demonstrate that coverage predicted by DFT software is realistic when compared to actual fault coverage achieved in production. Using DFT software during PCB design to model the fault coverage of different test strategies and make ICT (in-circuit test) access tradeoffs can significantly reduce cost and improve quality. Defect capture rates more than doubled when using alternate test strategies and production line beat rates varied significantly depending on the test strategy chosen. When DFT software enables these decisions early in the product life cycle, both OEMs and EMS providers can win by driving cost reductions through the entire product life cycle from NPI (new product introduction) through manufacturing and warranty.","","0-7803-7301","10.1109/IEMT.2002.1032780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1032780","","Design optimization;Software testing;Design for testability;Software design;Production;Costs;Software tools;Design engineering;Software quality;Medical services","printed circuit design;printed circuit testing;design for testability;circuit optimisation;circuit CAD;fault diagnosis","design for test;new product introduction;PCB design;limited in-circuit test access;test strategy optimization;electronics manufacturing services;test approach quantitative analysis;DFT software tools;board design testability analysis;DFT software coverage prediction;fault coverage modeling;ICT access tradeoffs;cost reduction;quality improvement;defect capture rates;production line beat rates;CAD;product life cycle;OEM;EMS providers;NPI;warranty;PCB test","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is also very difficult to reuse and port a software-pipelined loop to other processors, especially when the original sequential code is unavailable.

While early work on SBST has proposed several promising ideas, many challenges remain in applying SBST to realistic embedded processors. We propose a systematic scalable methodology for SBST that automates several key steps. The proposed methodology consists of (i) identifying test program templates that are well suited for test delivery to each module within the processor, (ii) extracting input/output mapping functions that capture the controllability/observability constraints imposed by a test program template for a specific module-under-test, (iii) generating module-level tests by representing the input/output mapping functions as virtual constraint circuits, and (iv) automatic synthesis of a software self-test program from the module-level tests. We propose novel RTL simulation-based techniques for template ranking and selection, and techniques based on the theory of statistical regression for extraction of input/output mapping functions. An important advantage of the proposed techniques is their scalability, which is necessitated by the significant and growing complexity of embedded processors. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology, we have applied it to a commercial state-of-the-art embedded processor (Xtensa form Tensilica Inc.). We believe this is the first practical demonstration of software-based self-test on a processor of such complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that software self-test programs generated using the proposed methodology are able to detect most (95.2%) of the functionally testable faults, and achieve significant simultaneous improvements in fault coverage and test length compared with conventional functional test.","","1-58113-688","10.1109/DAC.2003.1219068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219068","","Built-in self-test;Automatic testing;Software testing;Circuit testing;Circuit faults;System testing;Controllability;Observability;Circuit synthesis;Circuit simulation","integrated circuit testing;logic testing;built-in self test;programmable circuits;microprocessor chips;fault tolerant computing","software-based self-test methodology;complex programmable processor;systems-on chip;embedded processor;scalable methodology;test program template;mapping function;controllability constraint;observability constraint;virtual constraint circuit;automatic synthesis;RTL simulation-based technique;template ranking;statistical regression;manufacturing test;at-speed test","","75","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SymSoft is used to optimize and tune the algorithmic level description of an MPEG Layer III (MP3) audio decoder for the SmartBadge (Maguire et al, 1998) portable embedded system.

The author argues that this inherent potential ATE system capability has not been used effectively. It has been treated as an afterthought and implemented by the most prosaic of methods. The results of this inadequate and inappropriate treatment of ATE self-test has been stagnation in improved MTBF of new ATE systems and regression in MTTR. The maintenance and training problems for new and modern ATE have been exacerbated rather than reduced. The author contends that this situation is a result of neglect and apathy on the part of ATE systems developers who have failed to be innovative or attentive to modern system techniques in the design of self-test for their ATE.

The model first decomposes the structure of the software into a set of execution paths. The failure rate of the software system is related to the frequency and time of path traversal, and the probability of encountering an error during traversal. A second stage of decomposition is necessary to relate the path reliability to the module reliabilities. In the second decomposition the failure probabilities are expressed by combinatorial expressions involving the probabilities of failure of the individual modules. Since the basic model decomposes the structure into execution paths the model can be used to apportion reliabilities and test efforts among the various execution paths.

The approach is quite general and has been experimentally applied to the measurement of the frequency response of an amplifier-attenuator network, to fault diagnosis of a bandpass filter using time-domain measurements, and to efficient linearity tests of A/D and D/A converters.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-9064","10.1109/TEST.1990.114015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=114015","","Testing;Predictive models;Parameter estimation;Frequency measurement;Accuracy;Measurement errors;Manufacturing processes;Condition monitoring;Linear algebra;Software packages","analogue circuits;analogue-digital conversion;application specific integrated circuits;automatic testing;band-pass filters;circuit analysis computing;digital-analogue conversion;fault location;linear algebra;optimisation;production testing","A/D convertors;LINPACK;CLAM;MATLAB;linear error model;NIST;modeling;testing;mixed-signal devices;test confidence;selected test points;random measurement error;manufacturing process;linear algebra software packages;frequency response;amplifier-attenuator network;fault diagnosis;bandpass filter;time-domain measurements;linearity tests;D/A converters","","48","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The state code flow is compacted through polynomial division. An implicit 'justifying signature' method is applied at the state code level and ensures identical signatures before each join node of the control flow graph. The signatures are then independent of the path followed previously in the graph, and the comparison with reference data is greatly facilitated. This property is obtained by a clever state assignment, nearly without area overhead. The controllers can therefore be checked by signature analysis, either by a built-in monitor or by an external checker. The software implementation of the synthesis tool is presented, and the hardware implementation of the concurrent checking is described.<<ETX>>","","","10.1109/TEST.1989.82319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=82319","","Flow graphs;Hardware;Flowcharts;Circuit testing;Fault detection;Error correction;Monitoring;Control systems;Fault tolerant systems;Built-in self-test","automatic test equipment;automatic testing;control system CAD;fault location;logic arrays;logic CAD;logic testing;optimisation;programmable controllers;state assignment","optimised synthesis;ATE;logic testing;dedicated controllers;concurrent checking;detection of faults;state code flow;polynomial division;justifying signature;control flow graph;state assignment;signature analysis;built-in monitor;external checker","","6","34","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For data flow testing, test cases must be found to test the def-use pairs in a program. Since some of the def-use pairs identified through static analysis may be infeasible, no amount of testing effort may result in exhaustive testing of a program. Therefore in practice a fixed amount of effort is spent in testing a program. We develop an approach for assigning priorities to def-use pairs, such that the def-use pairs with higher priorities can be expected to require less effort for test case generation and therefore testing. Thus, by using the priorities as a guide for ordering the def-use pairs for testing, we can maximize the number of def-use pairs tested using a fixed amount of testing effort. We apply the technique to regression testing during the software maintenance phase, in which case the priorities are assigned to capture not only the difficulty in test case generation but also the likelihood that an error introduced by a program change is uncovered by the test case.","1063-6773","0-8186-7141-60-8186-7677","10.1109/ICSM.1995.526556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=526556","","Software testing;Computer science;Software maintenance;Data analysis","data flow analysis;program diagnostics;program testing;software maintenance;statistical analysis","priority based data flow testing;software testing;software development;software maintenance;def-use pairs;test case generation;regression testing;error;program change","","2","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Embedded software is characterized by a relatively long lifetime and by tight cost, performance and safety constraints. Several super-optimization techniques for embedded softwares based on multi-valued decision diagram (MDD) representations have been described in the literature, but they all share the same basic limitation. They are based on standard ordered MDD (OMDD) packages, and hence require a used order of evaluation for the MDD variables on every execution path. Free MDDs (FMDDs) lift this limitation, and hence open up more optimization opportunities. Finding the optimal variable ordering for FMDDs is a very difficult problem. Hence in this paper we describe a heuristic procedure that performs well in practice, and is based on FMDD cost estimation applied to recursive cofactoring. Experimental results show that our new variable ordering method obtains often.

The Negotiation is preceded by an initialization process (called an NSS Maintenance), which creates a customer-specific Data Base (DB).

Throughput and efficiency, along with measurement accuracy and repeatability, are major concerns of EMI test facility operators today. Therefore various test methods, particularly in radiated EMI compliance measurements, are in use to reduce the test time. The difficulty of optimizing test throughput by minimizing time however lies in the variety of factors impacting the test time. Some of them are related to the equipment under test (EUT) itself, others related to the measurement system used and test procedure applied. For these reasons no one single approach of achieving utmost efficiency under all circumstances is available. Understanding the impact and the nature of time contributing factors allows an easier streamlining of each individual measurement, especially in case a dedicated application software is used.","","0-7803-2573-70-7803-3608","10.1109/ISEMC.1995.523562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=523562","","Automatic testing;Electromagnetic interference;Velocity measurement;Time measurement;Throughput;System testing;Test facilities;Particle measurements;Software measurement;Application software","automatic test software;electromagnetic interference","automated EMI measurements;test speed;radiated EMI measurements;throughput;efficiency;measurement accuracy;measurement repeatability;EMI test facility;test methods;radiated EMI compliance measurements;equipment under test;measurement system;test procedure;dedicated application software","","1","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the dynamic properties of the system and the insufficiency of the failure data, the accurate parameter values are hard to determine. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis is often used in this stage to deal with this problem. In this paper, we study two optimal resource allocation problems in a module software during testing phase: (1) minimization of the remaining faults when a fixed amount of testing-effort is given, and (2) minimization of the required amount of testing-effort when a specific reliability requirement is given. Several useful optimization algorithms based on Lagrange multiplier method are proposed. Furthermore, we present the sensitivity analysis on these allocation problems in order to determine which of the parameters affects the system most.

Unfortunately, a design engineer may not know the best formulation in advance of attempting to set up and run a design optimization process. In order to attack this problem, we have developed a software environment that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system represents optimization strategies in terms of second-order dataflow graphs. Reformulations of strategies are implemented as transformations between dataflow graphs. The system permits the user to interactively generate and search a space of design optimization strategies, and experimentally evaluate their performance on test problems, in order to find a strategy that is suitable for his application domain.

We argue, and demonstrate, that significant energy savings could be ""left on the table"" if energy is not considered during the design of the software architecture. As a first step towards addressing this gap, we propose a systematic framework for software architectural transformations to reduce energy consumption. We consider software architectural transformations in the context of the multi-process software style driven by an operating system (OS), which is very commonly employed in energy-sensitive embedded systems. Our methodology for applying software architectural transformations consists of: (i) constructing a software architecture graph representation, (ii) deriving initial energy and performance statistics using a detailed energy simulation framework, (iii) constructing sequences of atomic software architectural transformations, guided by energy change estimates derived from high-level energy macro-models, that result in maximal energy reduction, and (iv) generation of program source code to reflect the optimized software architecture. We employ a wide suite of software architectural transformations whose effects span the application-OS boundary, including how the program functionality is structured into architectural components (e.g., application processes, signal handlers, and device drivers), and connectors between them (inter- component synchronization and communication mechanisms). We present experimental results on several multi-process embedded software programs, in the context of an embedded system that features the Intel StrongARM processor and the embedded Linux OS. The presented results clearly underscore the potential of the proposed methodology (up to 66.1% reduction in energy is obtained). In a broader sense, our work demonstrates the impact of considering energy during the earlier stages of the software design process.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253742","","Embedded software;Software architecture;Optimizing compilers;Software design;Embedded system;Software performance;Software systems;Energy consumption;Operating systems;Statistics","embedded systems;software architecture;operating systems (computers);minimisation","software architectural transformations;low energy embedded software;energy consumption reduction;multi-process software style;operating system;energy-sensitive embedded systems;software architecture graph representation;performance statistics;energy simulation framework;high-level energy macro-models;program source code generation;multi-process embedded software programs;Intel StrongARM processor;embedded Linux OS;software design process","","13","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exhaustive software testing is rarely possible because it becomes intractable for even medium sized software. Typically only parts of a program can be tested, but these parts are not necessarily the most error prone. Therefore, we are developing a more selective approach to testing by focusing on those parts that are most likely to contain faults, so that the most error prone paths can be tested first.

It is concluded that the use case model structure can be transformed into an operational profile model adding the profile information. As a next step, the use case model can be extended to include the information necessary for the operational profile.

Based on such information, a more focused software testing and inspection plan can be devised. Decision trees are attractive for a software quality classification problem which predicts the quality of program modules in terms of risk-based classes. They provide a comprehensible classification model which can be directly interpreted by observing the tree-structure. A simultaneous optimization of the classification accuracy and the size of the decision tree is a difficult problem, and very few studies have addressed the issue. This paper presents an automated and simplified genetic programming (gp) based decision tree modeling technique for the software quality classification problem. Genetic programming is ideally suited for problems that require optimization of multiple criteria. The proposed technique is based on multi-objective optimization using strongly typed GP. In the context of an industrial high-assurance software system, two fitness functions are used for the optimization problem: one for minimizing the average weighted cost of misclassification, and one for controlling the size of the decision tree. The classification performances of the GP-based decision trees are compared with those based on standard GP, i.e., S-expression tree. It is shown that the GP-based decision tree technique yielded better classification models. As compared to other decision tree-based methods, such as C4.5, GP-based decision trees are more flexible and can allow optimization of performance objectives other than accuracy. Moreover, it provides a practical solution for building models in the presence of conflicting objectives, which is commonly observed in software development practice.","1082-3409","0-7695-2038","10.1109/TAI.2003.1250214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250214","","Decision trees;Software quality;Classification tree analysis;Genetic programming;Software systems;Software testing;Inspection;Computer industry;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control","software quality;genetic algorithms;decision trees;program testing;software metrics","GP-based decision trees;software quality classification;software system;software testing;software inspection;program module;risk-based classes;classification model;tree-structure;simultaneous optimization;automated genetic programming;multiple criteria;S-expression tree;C4.5 decision tree;software development;software metrics;multiobjective optimization;misclassification cost","","12","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With slight modification, it can also be applied to all types of data-flow-oriented test criteria. The model can be used for program testing based on any coverage criterion of the structural testing approach. If a mixture of multiple test criteria is needed, the model is still workable. The model can be applied to program testing with various objective functions and can be extended to multiple goal objective function problems. Since the objective functions are independent from the constraints of test criteria, it is possible to have various combinations of optimization criteria and coverage requirements according to the specified test strategy.

Also, it is necessary to estimate the time interval during which the remaining faults will not influence the program. This problem is vital for estimating the cost of the software project. At present about three dozen statistical models (called software reliability models) are used to get such estimates. However, these statistical models lack convincing theoretical-explanation. They are semi-heuristic, and often look like curve-fitting. In this paper, we consider a fuzzy approach to program testing.

Proceedings.","","2004","","","394","404","Reliability of a software application, its failure rate and the residual number of faults in an application are the three most important metrics that provide a quantitative assessment of the failure characteristics of an application. Typically, one of many stochastic models known as software reliability growth models (SRGMs) is used to describe the failure behavior of an application in its testing phase, and obtain an estimate of the above metrics. In order to ensure analytical tractability, SRGMs are based on an assumption of instantaneous repair and thus the estimates of the metrics obtained using SRGMs tend to be optimistic. In practice, fault repair activity consumes a nonnegligible amount of time and resources. Also, repair may be conducted according to many policies which are reflective of the schedule and budget constraints of a project. A few research efforts that have sought to incorporate repair into SRGMs are restrictive, since they consider only one of the several SRGMs, model the repair process using a constant rate, and provide an estimate of only the residual number of faults. These techniques do not address the issue of estimating application failure rate and reliability in the presence of repair. In this paper we present a generic framework which relies on the rate-based simulation technique in order to provide the capability to incorporate various repair policies into the finite failure nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) class of software reliability growth models. We also present a technique to compute the failure rate and the reliability of an application in the presence of repair. The potential of the framework to obtain quantitative estimates of the above three metrics taking into consideration different repair policies is illustrated using several scenarios.","1530-1435","0-7695-2129","10.1109/METRIC.2004.1357924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357924","","Application software;Software reliability;Stochastic processes;Phase estimation;Computer science;Reliability engineering;Software testing;Computational modeling;Information technology;Environmental economics","software fault tolerance;software metrics;software maintenance;program testing;probability","software failure rate;repair policies;software reliability growth models;rate-based simulation;finite failure nonhomogeneous Poisson process;software metrics","","7","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a testing strategy based on a classification of vulnerabilities to develop secure and stable systems. This taxonomy will enable a system testing and maintenance group to understand the distribution of security vulnerabilities and prioritize their testing effort according to the impact the vulnerabilities have on the system.

This disturbing tendency ignores two facts that surface in virtually every analysis of the Year 2000 challenge: fifty percent or more of the effort will be in testing; and despite consuming a wealth of resources each year, current testing practices cannot satisfy the demands of current maintenance unrelated to the Y2K conversion. For the moment, most organizations continue to delay action on the Y2K Test problem while wading through the dozens of available analysis and conversion solutions. As a result, many Y2K projects have started on master plans that will need major revision once the true needs and benefits of testing automation become apparent.

"Summary of dynamically discovering likely program invariants","M. D. Ernst","Lab. for Comput. Sci., MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA","Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance. ICSM 2001","","2001","","","540","544","The dissertation dynamically discovering likely program invariants introduces dynamic detection of program invariants, presents techniques for detecting such invariants from traces, assesses the techniques' efficacy, and points the way for future research. Invariants are valuable in many aspects of program development, including design, coding, verification, testing, optimization, and maintenance. They also enhance programmers' understanding of data structures, algorithms, and program operation. Unfortunately, explicit invariants are usually absent from programs, depriving programmers and automated tools of their benefits. The dissertation shows how invariants can be dynamically detected from program traces that capture variable values at program points of interest. The user runs the target program over a test suite to create the traces, and an invariant detector determines which properties and relationships hold over both explicit variables and other expressions. Properties that hold over the traces and also satisfy other tests, such as being statistically justified, not being over unrelated variables, and not being implied by other reported invariants, are reported as likely invariants. Like other dynamic techniques such as testing, the quality of the output depends in part on the comprehensiveness of the test suite. If the test suite is inadequate, then the output indicates how, permitting its improvement. Dynamic analysis complements static techniques, which can be made sound but for which certain program constructs remain beyond the state of the art. Experiments demonstrate a number of positive qualities of dynamic invariant detection and of a prototype implementation, Daikon. Invariant detection is accurate-it rediscovers formal specifications-and useful-it assists programmers in programming tasks. It runs quickly and produces output of modest size. Test suites found in practice tend to be adequate for dynamic invariant detection.","1063-6773","0-7695-1189","10.1109/ICSM.2001.972767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972767","","Testing;Instruments;Programming profession;Detectors;Data structures;Formal specifications;Laboratories;Computer science;Design optimization;Prototypes","software maintenance;program verification;program testing;data structures","dynamically discovering likely program invariants;program invariants;software coding;software verification;software testing;software maintenance;data structures;Daikon","","6","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proceedings.","","2003","","","175","184","The ""stopping rule"" problem which involves determining an optimal release time for a software application at which costs justify the stop test decision has been addressed by several researchers. However, most of these research efforts assume instantaneous fault correction, an assumption that underlies many software reliability growth models, and hence provide optimistic predictions of both the cost at release and the release time. In this paper, we present an economic cost model which takes into consideration explicit fault correction in order to provide realistic predictions of release time and release cost. We also present a methodology to compute the failure rate of the software in the presence of fault correction, which is necessary in order to apply the cost model. We illustrate the utility of the cost model to provide realistic predictions of release time and cost with a case study.","","0-7695-2064","10.1109/SEW.2003.1270741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270741","","Cost function;Software reliability;Software testing;Predictive models;Application software;Software debugging;Computer science;Economic forecasting;Programming;Delay","software reliability;program testing","optimal software release time;fault correction;stopping rule problem;stop test decision;software reliability;economic cost model","","6","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Test software design and development often represents a significant portion of overall test system development time and cost. Therefore, any component, tool, or technique that minimizes the test system development effort required has value in meeting the challenge. Many instrument manufacturers and T&M software vendors now provide IVI instrument drivers designed to help test engineers incorporate their equipment and software into test systems. IVI drivers are the latest industry effort to provide an improved interface between test software and test instruments. Building on SCPI and VXIPnP drivers, IVI drivers offer features and functions with real potential to address test system development challenges. However, IVI drivers aren't appropriate for every situation; realizing the full potential of the improvements incorporated in them requires a good understanding of driver architecture, features, and functions. This paper provides a guided tour of IVI instrument drivers, designed to help test engineers understand how to obtain the maximum benefits from using them. First, the different styles of IVI drivers are described. The basic architecture of drivers is discussed, as well as guidelines for installing, configuring, and using them. Techniques for optimizing performance, evaluating tradeoffs, and troubleshooting are described. The tour concludes with a discussion of more advanced topics, including simulation, multithreading, and extending and modifying driver functionality.","1088-7725","0-7803-8449","10.1109/AUTEST.2004.1436819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436819","","Instruments;System testing;Software testing;Costs;Design engineering;Throughput;Software design;Manufacturing;Software systems;Computer industry","automatic test software;automatic test equipment;multi-threading;distributed object management;object-oriented programming;software architecture;formal specification;virtual instrumentation","test software design;test software development;IVI instrument driver;test instrument;troubleshooting;simulation;multithreading;IVI architecture specification;distributed object management;virtual instrumentation","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In other words, the behavior seen during the testing process may not be seen at runtime. Due to the uncertainties associated with nondeterminism, the standard view is that we should avoid such nondeterminate systems, especially for systems requiring high reliability. While this is a valid guideline, at least in two application areas such nondeterminacy is unavoidable. Early life-cycle requirements and AI software are becoming widely used, yet both are imprecise and may exhibit nondeterminate behaviour if explored rigorously by a test device. Based on a literature review and some theoretical studies, we argue that many stable properties exist within the space of all possible nondeterminate behaviors. However, we also show that seemingly trivial changes to a nondeterministic system can turn an easily testable system into an impossibly hard system to test. Finally, we stress that this analysis does not imply a correlation between stable zones of nondeterminate testability and the ultimate maintainability of nondeterminate systems. That is, while we are optimistic about testing nondeterminate systems, we remain cautious about the maintenance of such systems.","1071-9458","0-7695-0807","10.1109/ISSRE.2000.885874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885874","","System testing;Artificial intelligence;Uncertainty;Software reliability;Statistics;Runtime;Guidelines;Stress;Maintenance;Modems","program testing;artificial intelligence;software maintenance;stability;software reliability","nondeterminate systems testing;uncertainties;reliability;life-cycle requirements;AI software;literature review;stable properties;nondeterminate behaviors;nondeterminate testability;stable zones;system maintainability;software maintenance","","6","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As boards become more dense and more complex, debug of functional failures will become more and more difficult. Test strategies try to detect and diagnose failures early on in the test process (component and structural tests), but inevitably some defects are not detected until functional testing is done on the board. Finding these defects usually requires an ""expert"", with engineering level skills in both hardware and software. Depending on the complexity of the product, it could take several months (even years) to develop this level of expertise. During the initial product ramp, this expertise is usually most needed and often unavailable. Debug time is usually very long and scrap rates are generally high. This paper will provide an overview of reasoning-based diagnosis techniques and how they can significantly decrease debug time, especially during new product introduction. Because these engines are ""model-based"", there is no guarantee how they will perform in real life. In almost all cases, the reasoning engine will have to be modified based on instances where the reasoning engine could not correctly identify the failing component. Making these adjustments to the reasoning is a very complex and sometimes risky endeavor. While the new model may correctly identify the previously missed failure, the reasoning may have been altered to a point where several other diagnoses have now been unknowingly compromised. This paper will propose enhancements to the reasoning engine that will allow a simpler approach to adapting to diagnostic escapes without risking compromises to the original diagnostic engine","1089-3539;2378-2250","0-7803-9038","10.1109/TEST.2005.1583974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583974","","Engines;Inference mechanisms;Cost function;Circuit testing;System testing;Hardware;Production systems;Adders;Manufacturing processes;Bayesian methods","automatic test pattern generation;case-based reasoning;fault simulation;printed circuit testing","reasoning diagnosis;production defects;backend costs;functional test failures debugging;manufacturing process;failure detection;failure diagnosis;test process;component tests;structural tests;functional testing;debug time;reasoning engine;failing component","","22","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our aim is to validate a program with respect to a target property, that is to exercise the program and observe whether the property's violated or not. We define a test strategy for safety properties in cyclic control systems. It consists of the stepwise construction of test scenarios. Each step explores possible continuations of the dangerous scenarios found at the previous step, using black-box sampling techniques. Here, emphasis is put on using a heuristic search technique - namely, simulated annealing - an automatic way to ample over the input pace. Empirical investigation is conducted on a steam boiler case study. The target property is the ""non explosion"" of the boiler in presence of faults in the physical devices. The experimental results lead us to propose a revised version of the basic simulated annealing algorithm, whose efficiency is promising.","","0-7803-7983","10.1109/AICCSA.2003.1227524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227524","","Simulated annealing;Software testing;System testing;Safety;Automatic control;Control systems;Sampling methods;Boilers;Explosions;Software algorithms","simulated annealing;formal specification;program testing;boilers;program verification;control systems;sampling methods;heuristic programming","simulated annealing empirical investigation;property-oriented testing;property specification;cyclic control system;black-box sampling technique;heuristic search technique;steam boiler case study;software testing;high-level safety property;test data generation;optimization technique;target property","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SALT allows testers to capture relationships among partitions of input and output variables for a function under test. The tester can also specify (potential) updates to context which result from the function invocation. This context enables the generation of sequences of function invocations with expected outputs.

Failure detection is achieved by monitoring the target system's external inputs and outputs, in a 'black box' manner and comparing its behaviour with the formally specified behaviour of the system. The paper presents the Optimistic Path Prediction and Rollbacks (OPPR) approach to real time supervision. In this technique, the supervisor predicts a single likely behaviour of the target system and, if the observed behaviour does not match the prediction, rolls back and creates a new prediction of the legal behaviour. A failure is detected when the supervisor has explored all valid behaviours without matching the observed behaviour. The paper opens by introducing the field of real time supervision and examining existing techniques. The core of the paper presents the basic algorithm of the OPPR method, with an example to illustrate its operation.

We propose a solution by applying the source code level technologies to debugging software designs represented in a high-level specification and description language such as SDL. More specifically, we extend execution slice-based heuristics from source code-based debugging to the software design specification level. Suspicious locations in an SDL specification are prioritized by their likelihood of containing faults. Locations with a higher priority should be examined first rather than those with a lower priority as the former are more likely to contain the faults.

The paper describes how test criteria are formalized as mathematical constraint systems, how equivalent mutants are represented as infeasible constraints, and how infeasible constraints are detected.

"New optical switches enable automated testing with true flexibility","M. Bitting","Polatis Ltd., McKinney, TX, USA","Proceedings AUTOTESTCON 2004.","","2004","","","361","366","The proliferation of fiber optic systems in military and avionics platforms is driven by the ever increasing need for higher data rates to support multi-sensor data fusion. Traditionally, the test systems to support these optical deployments are manual and inefficient. Increasingly fast optical components require optical test equipment that is very expensive. To make cost effective test suites, it is essential that these high value resources be used efficiently. This is most effectively accomplished through test architectures that are remotely controlled and automatically scheduled. These test architectures also enable a diverse set of testing applications to be simultaneously executed within an optical test lab or manufacturing environment. The advent of optical matrix switching technology with sub 1dB insertion loss performance and repeatability measured in milli dB's opens up new doors for highly efficient, remotely controlled, automated test systems. The ultra low loss aspects of these switches enable distributed test architectures that were previously unrealizable. Distributed test architectures create a test environment where expensive test equipment can be leveraged over a greater number of test samples in a more timely and automated fashion. This allows the lab manager to prioritize and schedule tests across many users, DUTs, and test equipment bays in an operation that can run 24/7. This paper explores the enabling photonic switch technology and a couple generic test architectures that can be applied in a variety of automated applications to increase test equipment usage and efficiency, thus lowering end costs for deployable fiber optic components and systems.","1088-7725","0-7803-8449","10.1109/AUTEST.2004.1436883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436883","","Optical switches;Automatic testing;Test equipment;System testing;Optical fibers;Optical devices;Costs;Automatic control;Job shop scheduling;Optical losses","photonic switching systems;automatic test equipment;automatic test software;optical engineering computing;optical fibre testing","optical switch;automated testing;optical test equipment;optical matrix switching technology;distributed test architecture;photonic switch technology","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, defects are detected rather late in the development process. High rework and testing effort, typically under time pressure, lead to unpredictable delivery dates and uncertain product quality. This paper presents several methods for early defect detection and prevention that have been in existence for quite some time, although not all of them are common practice. However, to use these methods operationally and scale them to a particular project or environment, they have to be positioned appropriately in the life cycle, especially in complex projects. Modeling the development life cycle, that is the construction of a project-specific life cycle, is an indispensable first step to recognize possible defect injection points throughout the development project and to optimize the application of the available methods for defect detection and prevention. This paper discusses the importance of life cycle modeling for defect detection and prevention and presents a set of concrete, proven methods that can be used to optimize defect detection and prevention. In particular, software inspections, static code analysis, defect measurement and defect causal analysis are discussed. These methods allow early, low cost detection of defects, preventing them from propagating to later development stages and preventing the occurrence of similar defects in future projects.","","0-7695-1878","10.1109/STEP.2002.1267624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1267624","","Testing;Optimization methods;Costs;Consumer electronics;Jacobian matrices;Application software;Concrete;Inspection;Particle measurements;Software measurement","program testing;software reliability;software quality;software performance evaluation;software development management;project management;program diagnostics","life cycle modeling;defect detection;defect prevention;organization dynamic testing;development process;product quality;complex project;development life cycle;project-specific life cycle;defect injection point;development project;optimization;software inspections;static code analysis;defect measurement;defect causal analysis;low cost detection;quality demand","","3","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a previous work we elaborated a multifrequency test generation method (TPG) for such circuit faults. The method was formulated as a series of optimization problems that were solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) available in MATLAB. Such a standard optimization method processes local information and, consequently, cannot guarantee that the found solution is global. This may lead to a poor test selection. Furthermore, the method is semiautomatic and depends on various parameters that must be selected by an experienced user. In this paper, we propose a method based on constraint logic programming (CLP) using relational interval arithmetic (RIA) to solve these optimization problems as a series of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The method is fully automatic and provides tight and guaranteed bounds on the true range of a multivariable nonlinear function. The correctness of the bounds stems from the enumeration of subdivisions of the function and its variable domains while discarding those subdivisions containing no solution. The tightness (i.e., the closeness to the true range) of the bounds can be refined to any desired degree by increasing the fineness of subdivisions imposed on the variable domains and the stringency of the termination criterion at the cost of an increased CPU time. The TPG method was implemented in CLP (BNR) prolog. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a number of nonlinear functions known to be difficult, and two realistic electronic circuits in the context of TPG. Our algorithm accelerated the computation of the various parameters related to the test of a biquadratic filter by a factor ranging from 11 to 29 as compared to the Monte Carlo method.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/43.748163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=748163","","Tolerance analysis;Circuit testing;Circuit faults;Optimization methods;Automatic testing;Analog circuits;Quadratic programming;MATLAB;Logic programming;Arithmetic","analogue integrated circuits;linear network analysis;tolerance analysis;logic programming;constraint theory;integrated circuit testing;fault diagnosis;arithmetic;circuit analysis computing;automatic test software;optimisation","worst case tolerance analysis;CLP-based multifrequency test generation;linear analog circuits;minimal test sets;automatic test set generation;parametric faults;circuit faults;optimization problems;constraint logic programming;relational interval arithmetic;constraint satisfaction problems;multivariable nonlinear function;termination criterion;CPU time;CLP PROLOG;biquadratic filter","","16","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Power constraints are increasingly becoming the critical component of the design specification of these systems. At present, however, power analysis tools can only be applied at the lower levels of the design-the circuit or gate level. It is either impractical or impossible to use the lower level tools to estimate the power cost of the software component of the system. This paper describes the first systematic attempt to model this power cost. A power analysis technique is developed that has been applied to two commercial microprocessors-Intel 486DX2 and Fujitsu SPARClite 934. This technique can be employed to evaluate the power cost of embedded software. This can help in verifying if a design meets its specified power constraints. Further, it can also be used to search the design space in software power optimization. Examples with power reduction of up to 40%, obtained by rewriting code using the information provided by the instruction level power model, illustrate the potential of this idea.<<ETX>>","1063-8210;1557-9999","","10.1109/92.335012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=335012","","Embedded software;Costs;Embedded computing;Circuits;Application software;Logic;Minimization;Power system modeling;Embedded system;Silicon","real-time systems;software cost estimation;software performance evaluation;computer testing;integrated circuit testing","embedded software;software power minimization;dedicated processor;power constraints;power analysis tools;power analysis technique;microprocessors;Intel 486DX2;Fujitsu SPARClite 934;design space;power reduction;instruction level power model","","485","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This information assists designers in identifying weaknesses in large systems that can lead to system failures. Through analysis and modeling techniques based in graph theory, modules are assessed and rated as to the criticality of their position in the software system. Graphical representation at two levels facilitates the use of cut set analysis, which is our main focus. While the task of finding all cut sets in any graph is NP-complete, the tool intelligently applies cut set analysis by limiting the problem to provide only the information needed for meaningful analysis. In this paper, we examine the methodology and algorithms used in the implementation of this tool and consider future refinements. Although further testing is needed to assess performance on increasingly complex systems, preliminary results look promising. Given the growing demand for reliable software and the complexities involved in the design of these systems, further research in this area is indicated.","","0-7803-8215","10.1109/RAMS.2004.1285457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285457","","Large-scale systems;Fault tolerant systems;Software systems;Fault tolerance;Software design;Software tools;Application software;Software safety;Redundancy;Information analysis","computational complexity;optimisation;graph theory;software fault tolerance;computer aided software engineering","large scale fault-tolerant software systems;computer-aided software design tool;graph theory;NP-complete","","2","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When testing large programs, the individual procedures are first tested in isolation during unit testing. Integration testing is performed to specifically test the procedure interfaces. The procedures in a program are integrated and tested in several steps. Since each integration step requires data-flow analysis to determine the new test requirements, the accumulated cost of repeatedly analyzing a program can contribute considerably to the overhead of testing. Data-flow analysis is typically computed using an exhaustive approach or by using incremental data-flow updates. This paper presents a new and more efficient approach to data-flow integration testing that is based on demand-driven analysis. We developed and implemented a demand-driven analyzer and experimentally compared its performance during integration testing with the performance of (i) a traditional exhaustive analyzer, and (ii) an incremental analyzer. Our experiments show that demand-driven analysis is faster than exhaustive analysis by up to a factor of 25.

It shows that an ordinary test generator for single stuck-at faults can be used to perform arbitrary transformations in a combinational circuit and discusses how this approach relates to conventional multilevel minimization techniques based on Boolean division. Furthermore, effective heuristics are presented to decide what network manipulations are promising for minimizing the circuit. By identifying indirect implications between signals in the circuit, transformations can be derived which are ""good"" candidates for the minimization of the circuit. A main advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates directly on the structural netlist description of the circuit so that the technical consequences of the performed transformations can be evaluated in an easy way, permitting better control of the optimization process with respect to the specific goals of the designer. Therefore, the presented technique can serve as a basis for optimization techniques targeting nonconventional design goals. This paper only considers area minimization, and our experimental results show that the method presented is competitive with conventional technology-independent minimization techniques. For many benchmark circuits, our tool, the Hannover implication tool, based on learning (HANNIBAL) achieves the best minimization results published to date. Furthermore, the optimization approach presented is shown to be useful in formal verification.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/43.594832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=594832","","Automatic test pattern generation;Circuit testing;Performance evaluation;Design optimization;Minimization methods;Automatic logic units;Logic testing;Circuit faults;Combinational circuits;Signal processing","multivalued logic;circuit optimisation;minimisation of switching nets;logic CAD;formal verification;automatic test software;combinational circuits;logic testing;learning (artificial intelligence);integrated logic circuits;circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing","multilevel logic optimization;equivalence checking;implication analysis;automatic test pattern generation;ATPG;combinational circuit;multilevel minimization techniques;Boolean division;structural netlist description;area minimization;Hannover implication tool;HANNIBAL;recursive learning;formal verification","","30","38","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes the concept of weighted object relation diagram (WORD) by extending the traditional object relation diagram (ORD). When generating the inter-class test order based on WORD, minimizing the number of realistic stubs (not the number of classes to be stubbed) is regarded as optimization objective. Some heuristic rules, such as association intensity, cycling weight and direction factors of edges, are used as important criteria to cut association edges to break cycles. An improved algorithm AICTO is presented via analyzing some principles of the existing methods and overcoming some of their drawbacks. This algorithm has some merits such as the fewer number of classes to be stubbed, holding the association edges with higher RD and excellent stability. In practice, the algorithm AICTO has been applied to our C/C++ program testing prototype CppTest and produces favorable effects.","","0-7695-2432","10.1109/CIT.2005.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1562776","","Clustering algorithms;Software testing;Fault detection;Educational institutions;Computer science;Algorithm design and analysis;Stability;Prototypes;Information technology;Sorting","program testing;object-oriented programming;software prototyping","inter-class test order;cluster level testing;weighted object relation diagram;optimization objective;heuristic rules;association intensity;C;C++;program testing prototype;CppTest","","2","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because it pays off to invest CPU time in the optimal software pipelining of time-critical parts of a design, an integer programming approach is proposed for simultaneous scheduling and software pipelining. The integer programming techniques in the literature do not support cyclic (repetitive) signal flow, graphs, and/or do not allow optimization of the storage cost of delay lines during software pipelining. The new contributions in this paper are the full integration of software pipelining and scheduling, based on a new timing model that supports cyclic signal flow, graphs and optimization of delay line storage costs.

Testing results are analyzed for different strategies such as using all of the historical data, using the most recent windows, and using the current window only. Based on the results, test cases are ranked according to their potency to detect faults; and oracles and the confidence level of each oracle are established for individual test cases at runtime. In addition, different strategies are proposed to determine the optimal window size at runtime.

In this paper we describe an improved permutation proof rule which considers the initial conditions and invariant conditions of the loop. This new proof rule not only improves the validation process for compile-time optimizations, it can also be used to ensure the correctness of speculative loop optimizations, the aggressive optimizations which are only correct under certain conditions that cannot be known at compile time.

Our approach is no magic bullet, but it offers a reasoned methodology that has proven to be useful in the trenches. Our methodology, like many useful things, is a mix of art and engineering. The idea is straightforward: design a system with security in mind, analyze the system in light of known and anticipated risks, rank the risks according to their severity, test to the risks, and cycle broken systems back through the design process. The process outlined above has one essential underlying goal: avoiding the unfortunately pervasive penetrate-and-patch approach to computer security-that is, avoiding the problem of desperately trying to come up with a fix to a problem that is being actively exploited by attackers. In simple economic terms, finding and removing bugs in a software system before its release is orders of magnitude cheaper and more effective than trying to fix systems after release.","0018-9162;1558-0814","","10.1109/2.755011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=755011","","System testing;Resource management;Solids;Risk analysis;Data security;Software engineering;Protection;Information security;Power system security;Silver","software reliability;software quality;security of data;risk management","software assurance;security analysis;anticipated risks;broken systems;design process;penetrate-and-patch approach;economic terms;software system","","6","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Plug and play testbed to enable responsive space missions","J. Summers","MicroSat Syst. Inc., Littleton, CO, USA","2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","","2005","","","557","563","There exists a growing need in the DOD for a tactical or responsive space asset to support real-time battlefield intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The desired attributes include being: 1. responsive /sub e/ployable in days; 2. affordable - expendable tactical resources at a cost comparable to other tactical systems; 3. employable - assets must support the joint force commander (JFC); 4. integrated space/air/terrestrial system-of-systems - full network connectivity, bandwidth on demand, and augment other assets. To the warfighter, a responsive space asset would provide the capability to respond to unanticipated military needs in days, providing flexibility of response to rapidly field tailored payloads and coverage. This capability could also provide rapid reconstitution after a loss from attack or failure and counteract enemy adaptation, through denial or deception, to existing space capabilities. Most importantly the short deployment times and low cost would provide the United States a means for efficiently using the versatility, and relative safety of space to provide real-time support to the war fighter. To be responsive the space element must possess a modular design supporting ""plug and play"" (PnP) architecture, leveraging commercial parts and standards. Lending itself to a lean production and integration environment again utilizing standard interfaces and taking advantage of pre-qualified inventoried subsystems. Rapid deployment of these elements will make use of ""canned"" mission planning tools, tailored orbits for a given theater, built-in health and status monitoring, and autonomous test and checkout software and operations. The two emerging responsive mission objectives include space control and tailored, tactical intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR). Space control involves a situational awareness to sense threats against, and provide protection for, US space assets. The tailored, tactical missions offer high tempo ISR operations such as target characterization and emitter location in theater, perform real-time blue force tracking, and provide gap-filler, specialized communications support. The challenge is to develop and qualify the satellite technologies and rapid integration and test processes to support an operational responsive system in the next five years. Under an Air Force Research Laboratory SBIR program, MicroSat Systems is developing a PnP testbed to enable an operational responsive capability through development and ground validation of the various elements. Those elements include the mission definition and CONOPS specification processes, space segment, and the operational prioritization, tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PTPED) process/infrastructure. Specific to providing an end-to-end mission simulation, the testbed should be equipped with the modeling and simulation tools to develop tactical satellite CONOPS and provide the warfighter with a front end tool for training. To validate utility to the end-user the testbed must be equipped with the capability to simulate the data processing and dissemination infrastructure envisioned to provide the battlefield commander with real-time data. The space segment of the testbed should consist of the hardware and software elements required to simulate the operations of a fully functional satellite system. The approach to developing a responsive mission testbed includes defining requirements, hardware/software architecture, technology development roadmap, starting with a core capability, and incrementally integrating and validating the developing components and processes as they emerge.","1095-323X","0-7803-8870","10.1109/AERO.2005.1559345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1559345","","Plugs;Space missions;Space technology;Software testing;Satellites;System testing;Surveillance;Reconnaissance;Costs;Hardware","command and control systems;military aircraft;aerospace simulation;automatic test software;aerospace safety;software tools;hardware-software codesign;surveillance","plug and play testbed;responsive space missions;tactical systems;joint force commander;integrated space-air-terrestrial system-of-systems;responsive space asset;real-time support;war fighter;mission planning tools;health monitoring;status monitoring;autonomous test software;checkout software;space control;tactical intelligence;tactical surveillance;tactical reconnaissance;situational awareness;tactical missions;satellite technologies;operational responsive system;mission simulation;simulation tools;tactical satellite;CONOPS;data processing;dissemination infrastructure;battlefield commander;hardware-software architecture;technology development","","2","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative. In many cases there are several representatives (each one with his own view of the system and different priorities) and then some XP practices should be modified. In the paper we assess XP from two points of view: the capability maturity model and the Sommerville-Sawyer model (1997). We also propose how to introduce documented requirements to XP, how to modify the planning game to allow many customer representatives and how to get a wider perspective of a system to be built at the beginning of the project lifecycle.","1090-705X","0-7695-1465","10.1109/ICRE.2002.1048543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048543","","Capability maturity model;Documentation;Programming profession;Software engineering;Software testing;Software maintenance;Oral communication;Automatic testing;System testing;Electronic mail","formal specification;software engineering","extreme programming;XP;requirements engineering practices;agile software development methodology;software engineering;software maintenance;documentation;capability maturity model;Sommerville-Sawyer model;planning game","","10","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An execution slice with respect to a given test case is the set of code executed by this test, and two blocks are data dependent if one block contains a definition that is used by another block or vice versa. Not only can our approach reduce the search domain for program debugging, but also prioritize suspicious locations in the reduced domain based on their likelihood of containing faults. More specifically, the likelihood of a piece of code containing a specific fault is inversely proportional to the number of successful tests that execute it. In addition, the likelihood also depends on whether this piece of code is data dependent on other suspicious code. A debugging tool, DESiD, was developed to support our method.

Fault diagnosis is a key component of this approach, requiring an accurate determination of the health and state of the system. An imprecise state assessment can lead to catastrophic failure due to an optimistic diagnosis, or conversely, result in underutilization of resources because of a pessimistic diagnosis. Differing from classical testing and other off-line diagnostic approaches, we develop procedures for maximal utilization of the system state information to provide for continual, on-line diagnosis and reconfiguration capabilities as an integral part of the system operations. Our diagnosis approach, unlike existing techniques, does not require administered testing to gather syndrome information but is based on monitoring the system message traffic among redundant system functions. We present comprehensive on-line diagnosis algorithms capable of handling a continuum of faults of varying severity at the node and link level. Not only are the proposed algorithms on-line in nature, but are themselves tolerant to faults in the diagnostic process. Formal analysis is presented for all proposed algorithms. These proofs offer both insight into the algorithm operations and facilitate a rigorous formal verification of the developed algorithms.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.637385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=637385","","Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerant systems;Costs;System testing;Fault detection;Monitoring;Algorithm design and analysis;Formal verification;Resource management","online operation;reconfigurable architectures;software fault tolerance;program diagnostics;program verification;program testing","online diagnosis;formal verification;reconfigurable fault tolerant system;operation dependability;fault detection;fault isolation;FDIR paradigm;fault diagnosis;optimistic diagnosis;pessimistic diagnosis;testing;system state information;system message traffic monitoring;redundant system functions","","30","40","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We have developed a method to automate the test plan generation for analog ICs, which are designed using a modular design concept similar to that of digital ICs. However, it is still not clear exactly how this method can be put in the design and manufacturing process. Overall the automated test program generation process requires intricate knowledge of the design database of the chip, and the destination automatic test equipment (ATE), on which online testing of the ICs is to be performed. At the same time, it should be noted that consideration needs to be given to intermediate stages of extracting information from the design database, selection of appropriate method for test plan generation, test method specifications, test plan format, test plan to test program translator, optimization of the overall test plan and corresponding tester specific test program, deletion and addition of the tests, simulation of the entire test environment including device under test (DUT), extracting information of non-testable areas and, design alteration for higher test coverage.

The survey has been carried out in two large software development organizations using 34 senior participants. The prioritization was carried out using the Incomplete Pairwise Comparison method (IPC). The analysis shows that there are large differences between the importance of the quality requirements studied. The differences between the views of different stakeholders are also analysed and it is found to be less than the difference between the quality requirements.

These models will help identify the high-risk components and connectors of the product architecture, so that remedial actions may be taken in order to control and optimize the development process and improve the quality of the product. In this paper, we present a risk assessment methodology which can be used in the early phases of the software life cycle. We use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and commercial modeling environment Rational Rose Real Time (RoseRT) to obtain UML model statistics. First, for each component and connector in software architecture, a dynamic heuristic risk factor is obtained and severity is assessed based on hazard analysis. Then, a Markov model is constructed to obtain scenarios risk factors. The risk factors of use cases and the overall system risk factor are estimated using the scenarios risk factors. Within our methodology, we also identify critical components and connectors that would require careful analysis, design, implementation, and more testing effort.

When the union of a BDF and LRF was used to classify quality, the predictive accuracy of quality and inspection cost was improved over that of using either function alone for the Space Shuttle. Also, the LRFs proved useful for ranking the quality of modules in a build. The significance of these results is that very high-quality classification accuracy (1.25% error) can be obtained while reducing the inspection cost incurred in achieving high quality. This is particularly important for safety-critical systems. Because the methods are general and not particular to the Shuttle, they could be applied to other domains. A key part of the LRF development was a method for identifying the critical value (i.e. threshold) that could discriminate between high and low quality, and at the same time constrain the cost of inspection to a reasonable value.","1530-1435","0-7695-1043","10.1109/METRIC.2001.915540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915540","","Logistics;Software quality;Inspection;Space shuttles;Cost function;Safety;Time factors;Predictive models;Testing;Quality control","software quality;forecasting theory;statistical analysis;Boolean functions;inspection;space vehicles;safety-critical software;software cost estimation;aerospace computing;subroutines;pattern classification;software metrics","logistic regression functions;Boolean discriminant functions;software quality prediction;quality classification ability;predictive accuracy;inspection cost;Space Shuttle;module quality ranking;classification accuracy;safety-critical systems;threshold identification method","","10","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on addressing this issue by developing a number of test problems and by suggesting a baseline algorithm. Since in a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem, the resulting Pareto-optimal set is expected to change with time (or, iteration of the optimization process), a suite of five test problems offering different patterns of such changes and different difficulties in tracking the dynamic Pareto-optimal front by a multiobjective optimization algorithm is presented. Moreover, a simple example of a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem arising from a dynamic control loop is presented. An extension to a previously proposed direction-based search method is proposed for solving such problems and tested on the proposed test problems. The test problems introduced in this paper should encourage researchers interested in multiobjective optimization and dynamic optimization problems to develop more efficient algorithms in the near future.","1089-778X;1089-778X;1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.831456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347158","","Testing;Computer aided software engineering;Design optimization;Constraint optimization;Optimal control;Search methods;Optimization methods;Computational modeling;Shape;Mechanical engineering","Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation","dynamic multiobjective optimization;multiple Pareto optimal solution;dynamic control loop;test problems;evolutionary computation","","206","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To distinguish the importance of different variables, the paper proposes a new concept - coverage about variables, based on program slicing, and adds powers according to their importance. Thus we can focus on the important variables to obtain higher test coverage. In most case, the coverage obtained by our method is bigger than that obtained by a traditional measure, because the coverage about a variable takes only the codes related into account, and the gradation model takes more factors into consideration when analyzing test coverage.","","0-7803-8242","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251465","","Computer science;Software testing;Computer science education;Educational programs;Software quality;Fluid flow measurement;Modems;Software engineering;Laboratories;Information processing","program testing;program slicing;software metrics;structured programming","coverage analysis;program slicing;program analysis;software testing;structural testing;gradation model;test coverage;test suite","","","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence a good framework for regression testing should provide the flexibility to configure it depending on the particular organization's needs while at the same time maximizing utilization. Manual processes are typically slow and error prone and result in under-utilization of valuable test resources.

Does the overall defect density of a software project vary with its module size distribution? Even more interesting is the question can we exploit this dependence to reduce the total number of defects? We examine the available data sets and propose a model relating module size and defect density. It takes into account defects that arise due to the interconnections among the modules as well as defects that occur due to the complexity of individual modules. Model parameters are estimated using actual data. We then present a key observation that allows use of this model for not just estimation of the defect density, but also potentially optimizing a design to minimize defects. This observation, supported by several data sets examined, is that the module sizes often follow exponential distribution. We show how the two models used together provide a way of projecting defect density variation. We also consider the possibility of minimizing the defect density by controlling module size distribution.","1071-9458","0-7695-0807","10.1109/ISSRE.2000.885861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885861","","Testing;Software systems;Computer science;Parameter estimation;Design optimization;Exponential distribution;Size control;Software reliability;Debugging;Hardware","software reliability;exponential distribution;parameter estimation;program testing","software module size distribution;software defect density;software project;data sets;model parameter estimation;exponential distribution;software reliability;program testing","","16","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Emphasis during system synthesis is usually on optimizing one or more objectives such as price, area, performance and power. Testability enhancement of the SOC solution so obtained follows as a postprocessing step to enable the application of precomputed test sequences to each embedded core and observe its responses. Unfortunately, performing test modifications after the SOC design has been optimized for target design constraints does not preserve the optimality of the solution obtained. In this paper, the authors present the first system-level synthesis for testability framework that integrates testability considerations into the synthesis process. Their work incorporates finite-state automata (FSA)-based symbolic testability analysis within the framework of an existing multiobjective optimization-based system synthesis tool to provide a viable solution. The experimental results show that the use of FSA-based testability analysis facilitates low test overheads and test application times without sacrificing the test coverage of the embedded cores. System synthesis through the integrated framework for a number of examples indicates that efficient SOC architectures, which tradeoff different architectural features such as integrated circuit price, power consumption, and area under real-time constraints, can now be easily generated with low testability costs.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2002.802265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043905","","System testing;Circuit testing;System-on-a-chip;Integrated circuit synthesis;Embedded system;Performance evaluation;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Automata;Automatic testing","hardware-software codesign;embedded systems;design for testability;microprocessor chips;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit testing;finite state machines","systems-on-a-chip;embedded systems;test synthesis;functional blocks;system-level synthesis;testability framework;embedded core;finite-state automata;symbolic testability analysis;multiobjective optimization-based tool;hardware-software cosynthesis;task graph specification","","5","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This approach is expanded to permit analysis of individual test points rather than entire paths, and to concentrate on domain errors. Faults are modeled as perturbing functions drawn from a vector space of potential faults and added to the correct form of an arithmetic expression. Sensitivity measures are derived which limit the possible size of those faults that would go undetected after the execution of a given test set. These measures open up an interesting view of testing, in which attempts are made to reduce the volume of possible faults which, were they present in the program being tested, would have escaped detection on all tests performed so far. The combination of these measures with standard optimization techniques yields a novel test-data-generation method called arithmetic fault detection.<<ETX>>","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.24727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=24727","","Perturbation methods;Software testing;Error correction;Fault detection;Size measurement;Volume measurement;Measurement standards;Optimization methods;Floating-point arithmetic;Computer science","error detection;perturbation techniques;program testing","error detection;sensitivity measures;software testing;arithmetic expressions;individual test points;domain errors;perturbing functions;vector space;potential faults;test set;standard optimization techniques;novel test-data-generation method;arithmetic fault detection","","22","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

ISSRE 2000","","2000","","","4","14","Despite the growing interest for component based systems, few works tackle the question of the trust we can bring into a component. The paper presents a method and a tool for building trustable OO components. It is particularly adapted to a design-by-contract approach, where the specification is systematically derived into executable assertions (invariant properties, pre/postconditions of methods). A component is seen as an organic set composed of a specification, a given implementation and its embedded test cases. We propose an adaptation of mutation analysis to the OO paradigm that checks the consistency between specification/implementation and tests. Faulty programs, called ""mutants"", are generated by systematic fault injection in the implementation. The quality of tests is related to the mutation score, i.e. the proportion of faulty programs it detects. The main contribution is to show how a similar idea can be used in the same context to address the problem of effective test optimization. To map the genetic analogy to the test optimization problem, we consider mutant programs to be detected as the initial preys population and test cases as the predators population. The test selection consists of mutating the ""predator"" test cases and crossing them over in order to improve their ability to kill the prey population. The feasibility of component validation using such a ""Darwinian"" model and its usefulness for test optimization are studied.","1071-9458","0-7695-0807","10.1109/ISSRE.2000.885856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885856","","Automatic testing;Built-in self-test;Contracts;Object oriented modeling;Buildings;Genetic mutations;Fault detection;System testing;Software quality;Context modeling","object-oriented programming;formal specification;program testing;software reliability;genetic algorithms","OO component trust;genetic analogy;component based systems;trustable OO components;design-by-contract approach;executable assertions;invariant properties;pre/postconditions;specification;ts embedded test cases;mutation analysis;OO paradigm;faulty programs;mutants;systematic fault injection;mutation score;test optimization;mutant programs;initial preys population;predators population;test selection;component validation;Darwinian model","","7","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

QUEM can be viewed as a type of achievement or job placement test administered to knowledge based systems to help system designers determine how the system should be used and by what level of user. To apply QUEM, a set of subjects, experienced judges, and problems must be identified. The subjects should have a broad range of experience levels. Subjects and the knowledge based system are asked to solve the problems; and judges are asked to rank order all solutions, from worst quality to best. The data from the subjects is used to construct a skill function relating experience to solution quality, and confidence bands showing the variability in performance. The system's quality ranking is then plugged into the skill function to produce an estimate of the system's experience level. QUEM can be used to gauge the experience level of an individual system, to compare two systems, or to compare a system to its intended users. This represents an important advance in providing quantitative measures of overall performance that can be applied to a broad range of systems.","1041-4347;1558-2191;2326-3865","","10.1109/69.649311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=649311","","System testing;Knowledge based systems;Humans;Problem-solving;Acoustic testing;Knowledge engineering;Databases;Costs;Manufacturing","knowledge based systems;knowledge verification;software performance evaluation;software metrics;software quality","QUEM;achievement test;knowledge based systems;Quality and Experience Metric;system skill level estimation;solution quality;quantitative measure;job placement test;experience levels;skill function;performance","","5","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Shifting perspectives on DFM","J. Sawicki","Mentor Graphics Corp., Beaverton, OR, USA","Sixth international symposium on quality electronic design (isqed'05)","","2005","","","19","","Summary form only given. There is one universal truth in terms of design for manufacturing (DFM) - DFM tools and disciplines have always existed. In micron technologies, DFM methodologies were applied to ensure acceptable yield and adequate test coverage. However, nanometer technology has ushered in new and significant yield and manufacturing considerations and constraints. The lack of a major increase in yield improvement between the 350 nm and 180 nm nodes suggests that yield loss mechanisms are not only increasing, but they are increasing fast enough that 'cosmetic' improvements in tools and methodologies are largely offset. If EDA tools are to assist the semiconductor industry at the 90 nm and 65 nm nodes, there must be profound changes to existing tools, and the introduction of new technologies that allow designers to consider and optimize for manufacturing at each stage of the design, verification, tapeout and test process. Where will these new tools and capabilities appear? They will show up in all parts of the design flow, and also on the manufacturing floor. In particular, an immediate focus for the EDA industry must be to deliver new technology in four key areas: process modeling (electrical and lithographic); statistical analysis and visualization; design optimization; test and inspection.","1948-3287;1948-3295","0-7695-2301","10.1109/ISQED.2005.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410551","","Design for manufacture;Electronic design automation and methodology;Design optimization;Electronics industry;Manufacturing processes;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device testing;Manufacturing industries;Statistical analysis;Visualization","design for manufacture;integrated circuit design;nanoelectronics;integrated circuit yield;electronic design automation;software tools;integrated circuit modelling;semiconductor process modelling;statistical analysis;data visualisation;optimisation;integrated circuit testing;inspection","design for manufacturing;DFM tools;nanometer technology;manufacturing considerations;yield loss mechanisms;EDA tools;design flow;manufacturing floor;electrical process modeling;lithographic process modeling;statistical analysis;visualization;design optimization;test;inspection;350 to 65 nm","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.00CH37016)","","2000","2","","717","721 vol.2","Radiated EMI compliance measurements are very time consuming, even when a high degree of automation is used. This is particularly true for measurements made on an open area test site (OATS), due to the presence of ambient signals and weather conditions. The overall test time is largely dependent on the number of signals emanating from the equipment under test (EUT), because their amplitudes must be maximized and measured. The maximization process involves changes in antenna height and polarization, as well as rotation of the EUT. It is mandatory to identify only the relevant signals for maximization and final measurement by using adequate test procedures, selecting proper system parameters, and performing tasks like signal discrimination efficiently. This paper first describes how relevant signals can be discerned in data traces of a swept EMI receiver by using a software algorithm. The significance of a user definable parameter of this algorithm, ""peak excursion"", is discussed. The overall measurement process also determines the test time. The application of amplitude comparisons to limit lines or margins, comparisons of signal lists and acoustic identification of signals, further reduce the number of emissions throughout the measurement process. An example of this process is outlined. Other tasks like the discrimination between ambient signals and EUT emissions or between EUT emissions and auxiliary equipment also contribute to the reduction of signals. A tool to efficiently accomplish this discrimination task, the polar plot, is also discussed.","","0-7803-5677","10.1109/ISEMC.2000.874709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=874709","","Testing;Electromagnetic interference;Signal processing;Time measurement;Open area test sites;Antenna measurements;Acoustic measurements;Automation;Area measurement;Particle measurements","electromagnetic interference;optimisation;electromagnetic wave polarisation;receivers;software packages;conformance testing","test signal reduction;open area test site;radiated EMI compliance measurements;OATS measurements;equipment under test;maximization process;antenna height;antenna polarization;EUT rotation;test procedures;system parameters;signal discrimination;data traces;swept EMI receiver;software algorithm;test time;acoustic identification;EUT emissions;polar plot;EMI compliance measurements","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There has been little systematic study of this problem yielding a resulting strategy which is effective and scalable. The proposed method concentrates upon user sequences of GUI objects and selections which collaborate, called complete interaction sequences (CIS), that produce a desired response for the user. A systematic method to test these CIS utilizes a finite-state model to generate tests. The required tests can be substantially reduced by identifying components of the CIS that can be tested separately. Since consideration is given to defects totally within each CIS, and the components reduce required testing further, this approach is scalable. An empirical investigation of this method shows that substantial reduction in tests can still detect the defects in the GUI. Future research will prioritize testing related to the CIS testing for maximum benefit if testing time is limited.","1071-9458","0-7695-0807","10.1109/ISSRE.2000.885865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885865","","Computer aided software engineering;Graphical user interfaces;Computational Intelligence Society;System testing;Collaboration;Application software;Logic;Explosions","program testing;graphical user interfaces;finite state machines","test case generation;GUI;complete interaction sequences;graphical user interfaces;finite-state model;software testing","","64","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The bus traces have been analyzed to identify temporal correlations between consecutive patterns. Second, a framework has been set up for the design of high-performance encoder/decoder architectures to reduce the transition activity of the system-level buses. Novel bus encoding schemes have been proposed, whose performance has been compared with the most widely adopted power-oriented encodings. The experimental results have shown that the proposed encoding techniques provide an average reduction in transition activity up to 74.11% over binary encoding for instruction address streams. The results indicate the suitability of the proposed techniques for high-capacitance wide buses, for which the power saving due to the transition activity reduction is not offset by the extra power dissipation introduced in the system by the encoding/decoding logic.","","1-58113-268","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843702","","Encoding;Decoding;Communication switching;Optimization methods;Communication system software;Circuits;Permission;Sun;Pattern analysis;Power dissipation","hardware-software codesign;encoding;decoding;program testing","power optimization;system-level address buses;software profiling;switching power;processor-to memory communication;benchmark programs;Sun SPARC V8 architecture;temporal correlations;high-performance encoder/decoder architectures;power-oriented encodings;encoding/decoding logic","","13","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It consists of a generalized diagnostic algorithm for the case where distributed system specifications (implementations) are given in the form of communicating nondeterministic finite state machines. Such algorithm localizes the faulty transition once the fault has been detected. The algorithm guarantees the correct diagnosis of any single (output and/or transfer) fault.

Fasolt uses a model of layout to drive the choice of optimizing transformations at the levels of scheduling and allocation; hence it is a feedback-driven optimization system. In choosing transformations, Fasolt takes placement and wiring into account in a way that has not been demonstrated in any other high-level synthesis system. Fasolt is also cyclic in that high-level transformations trigger changes at lower levels, which after analysis trigger further high-level changes. This implementation of Fasolt has an expanded set of transformation rules, timing-driven and area-driven transformations, and improved layout modeling capability. The authors present experimental results on three basic test cases and two major variations on the layout software.<<ETX>>","","","10.1109/EDAC.1991.206375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=206375","","Feedback;Costs;Wiring;High level synthesis;Logic testing;Software tools;Software testing;Very large scale integration;Hardware design languages;Software algorithms","circuit layout CAD;feedback;software tools;VLSI","register level datapath optimisation;Fasolt;software tool;model of layout;choice of optimizing transformations;levels of scheduling and allocation;feedback-driven optimization system;choosing transformations;high-level synthesis system;high-level transformations;expanded set of transformation rules;area-driven transformations;layout modeling capability;experimental results;test cases","","9","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To adequately insure themselves against potential liability, developers need tools to identify worst-case scenarios and help them quantify the risks associated with a piece of software. For assessing such risks associated with software, the authors recommend fault injection, which provides worst-case predictions about how badly a piece of code might behave and how frequently it might behave that way. By contrast, software testing states how good software is. But even correct code can have ""bad days"", when external influences keep it from working as desired. Fault injection is arguably the next best thing to having a crystal ball, and it certainly beats facing the future with no predictions at all. It should be a regular part of risk assessment. The greatest benefit from fault injection occurs when a piece of software does not tolerate injected anomalies.

The IV&V subjects were randomly assigned to use either the VBR approach or our previous value-neutral checklist-based reading (CBR) approach. The difference between groups was not statistically significant for number of issues reported, but was statistically significant for number of issues per review hour, total issue impact, and cost effectiveness in terms of total issue impact per review hour.

Digital Avionics Systems Conference. Proceedings (Cat. No.98CH36267)","","1998","1","","C12/1","C12/6 vol.1","Real-time systems are increasing in size and complexity. Software developers seek to maximize the performance, as well as minimize the memory requirements in order to meet the constraints of these systems. Traditionally, software developers have overcome these constraints by using an optimizing compiler. However, optimization carries a hidden price. Many Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) debuggers are unable to work effectively with optimized applications, because the one-to-one mapping of source to object code is often disturbed by optimization. While optimizing, a compiler is free to reorder or interleave the code for statements, so long as the semantics of the program are preserved. This causes two major problems for a debugger. First, selecting a representative instruction to be used when setting a breakpoint on a source-level statement becomes difficult. Second, at a given breakpoint, the value of a variable may differ from what it would be in the non-optimized version. This condition is known as non-currency. Each of these problems becomes a serious issue if a debugger is used to debug the deliverable code or to perform verification testing. This paper presents an in-depth study of the effects of loop-invariant optimization on debugging user applications. The paper will show how to significantly improve the performance of the debugger, with respect to breakpoints and non-current variables, when operating on code affected by this optimization.

Slider air bearing surface (ABS) designs that satisfy very strict multi-objective goals are of great importance for magnetic hard disk drives. Finding such optimal designs is a strongly nonlinear problem. In slider ABS optimization, the evaluation of the objective function for every single sample design takes substantial computation time. It is desirable to reduce the number of sample designs evaluated without losing the global property of the optimization algorithm. In this paper, we make use of the DIRECT (DIviding RECTangle) optimization technique, which is a deterministic global optimization technique developed by Jones et al.

This paper addresses the problem of timing verification at the entire chip level. We use a critical path tool, CRITIC, to obtain critical paths in an embedded combinational module. In order to reduce the complexity of checking whether the module-level critical path is indeed critical at the chip level, we use techniques from formal verification to extract the control behavior of the circuit, and check whether there is any control sequence which will justify the path to the chip level. The results of the experiments on several processor designs show that our approach is very effective in large sequential circuits such as microprocessors, where conventional ATPG techniques require inordinate amounts of CPU time. The experiments also show that the execution time remains reasonable as the circuit size increases, since we deal with a reduced control space rather than the entire state space of the circuit.","1093-0167","0-8186-7810","10.1109/VTEST.1997.599465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=599465","","Timing;Optimization methods;Formal verification;Process design;Sequential circuits;Microprocessors;Automatic test pattern generation;Central Processing Unit;Size control;State-space methods","design for testability;combinational circuits;logic testing;timing;automatic test software;formal verification;computer testing;integrated circuit testing;critical path analysis;circuit optimisation;logic CAD","chip-level functional timing verification;entire chip level;critical path tool;CRITIC tool;embedded combinational module;formal verification;control behavior;large sequential circuits;microprocessors;reduced control space;automated procedure;vigorous sensitization;extracted flow control machine","","1","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However this approach has limitations in that it is exceedingly difficult to identify, isolate, reproduce and debug failures and no single application may exercise most of the architectural corner cases of the CPU. Hence we have developed an x86 random instruction generator that generates code that has the characteristics of typical 32 bit protected mode programs.

"Identification of test process improvements by combining fault trigger classification and faults-slip-through measurement","L. -. Damm; L. Lundberg","Ericsson AB, Karlskrona, Sweden; NA","2005 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering, 2005.","","2005","","","10 pp.","","Successful software process improvement depends on the ability to analyze past projects and determine which parts of the process that could become more efficient. One source of such an analysis is the faults that are reported during development. This paper proposes how a combination of two existing techniques for fault analysis can be used to identify where in the test process improvements are needed, i.e. to pinpoint which activities in which phases that should be improved. This was achieved by classifying faults after which test activities that triggered them and which phase each fault should have been found in, i.e. through a combination of orthogonal defect classification (ODC) and faults-slip-through measurement. As a part of the method, the paper proposes a refined classification scheme due to identified problems when trying to apply ODC classification schemes in practice. The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated by applying it on an industrial software development project at Ericsson AB. The obtained measures resulted in a set of quantified and prioritized improvement areas to address in consecutive projects.","","0-7803-9507","10.1109/ISESE.2005.1541824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541824","","Fault diagnosis;Testing;Feedback;Software measurement;Phase measurement;Programming;Refining;Computer industry;Area measurement;Costs","software process improvement;software development management;software fault tolerance","fault trigger classification;faults-slip-through measurement;software process improvement;fault analysis;orthogonal defect classification;industrial software development project","","3","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tool's versatility allows it to be used to analyze a design in a range of application scenarios. Using this platform, this paper discusses actual examples of thermal model development and results. The results are first validated by comparing with datasheet information and experiments in an application lab.

ECTC '05.","","2005","","","504","512 Vol. 1","Due to demand for short time-to-market, drop testing has become a bottleneck for semiconductor and telecommunication industry. Therefore, there is a need for a faster and cheaper solution, i.e. validated drop impact model, which is accurate, reliable, and enables understanding of physics-of-failure for design improvement. Currently, there has been increasing interest and effort by researchers on board level drop test studies by numerical modeling. Several different modeling methods have been developed to satisfy the requirements in package design analysis, product qualification, and impact life prediction. In this paper, for the first time, various advanced drop test modeling techniques developed are systematically introduced, integrated, compared, and recommended for various applications, consisting of analysis type (dynamic vs. static), loading method (free-fall vs. input-G), and solver algorithm (explicit vs. implicit). Each combination of modeling techniques has its unique advantages, depending on applications. All the models are validated to show excellent first level correlation on the dynamic responses of PCB, second level correlation on the solder joint stress and failure mode, and third level correlation on impact life prediction. Dynamic model is required for accurate drop impact simulation, whereas static model is useful for quick design analysis and optimization. The free-fall drop model can be applied to provide fundamental understanding of different drop test conditions, i.e. drop height, contact surface, drop block, felt layer on the impact pulse. Once the impact pulse has been established, the input-G method can be used as a standard ""numerical drop test"" to perform design analysis and optimization for product qualification. Implicit solver is an alternative to explicit solver, saving software cost by maintaining only one type of solver, but the technical challenge is greater.","0569-5503;2377-5726","0-7803-8907","10.1109/ECTC.2005.1441312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1441312","","Predictive models;Qualifications;Design optimization;Software maintenance;Time to market;Semiconductor device testing;Communication industry;Numerical models;Packaging;Product design","integrated circuit modelling;impact testing;test equipment;integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit design;circuit optimisation;printed circuits;solders;life testing","drop impact modeling technique;drop testing;board level drop test;numerical model;package design analysis;product qualification;life prediction;loading method;solver algorithm;dynamic response;PCB;solder joint stress;dynamic model;drop impact simulation;free-fall drop model;drop height;contact surface;drop block;input-G method;numerical drop test;implicit solver","","14","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The trend is insensitive to the fact that maintenance testing is not the primary mission of operational users and that ineffective testing can be more a liability than an asset to the mission.

The dynamic background component must optimize both run-time efficiency and flexibility and is therefore a critical component in implementing enVision.

After tuning and during operation each cycle is measured and, if a failure is imminent, the system is retuned. During the tuning phase test vectors-either hardware embedded or software-select near maximum speed for a particular instance of the system. As self-tuning is predicated on self-test, it is essential to build in self-test features. These same self-test features are useful in circuit level performance monitoring.

Unfortunately, not all the paths identified using such analysis can be sensitized. This leads to a pessimistic estimation of the processor speed. Also, no amount of engineering effort spent on optimizing such paths can improve the timing performance of the chip. In the past we demonstrated initial results of how ATPG techniques can be used to identify false paths efficiently. Due to the gap between the physical design on which the static timing analysis of the chip is bused and the test view on which the ATPG techniques are applied to identify false paths, in many cases only sections of some of the paths in the full-chip were analyzed in our initial results. In this paper, we will fully analyze all the timing paths using the ATPG techniques, thus overcoming the gap between the testing and timing analysis techniques.

The individual preparation phase of software inspections has enlarged its focus from only comprehension to also include fault searching. Hence, reading techniques to support the reviewers on fault detection are needed. Usage-based reading (UBR) is a reading technique, which focuses on the important parts of a software document by using prioritized use cases. This paper presents a series of three UBR experiments on design specifications, with focus on the third. The first experiment evaluates the prioritization of UBR and the second compares UBR against checklist-based reading. The third experiment investigates the amount of information needed in the use cases and whether a more active approach helps the reviewers to detect more faults. The third study was conducted at two different places with a total of 82 subjects. The general result from the experiments is that UBR works as intended and is efficient as well as effective in guiding reviewers during the preparation phase of software inspections. Furthermore, the results indicate that use cases developed in advance are preferable compared to developing them as part of the preparation phase of the inspection.","","0-7695-1796","10.1109/ISESE.2002.1166932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166932","","Inspection;Software engineering;Bioreactors;Communication system software;Computer science;Technology planning;Fault detection;Testing;Engineering management","software engineering;inspection;program debugging","usage-based reading;experiments;software inspections;software development fault detection;software document;prioritized use cases;design specifications;checklist-based reading","","8","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern microprocessor-based protection relays can in principle respond intelligently to such input signals. This gives rise to the need for test equipment with the capability to evaluate protection relay performance for representative waveform data recorded for actual field conditions, or obtained alternatively by simulation using software packages such as the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). This paper describes a computer-based, multiphase, arbitrary waveform synthesizer for protection relay test applications.

Sci. & Eng., California Univ., Riverside, CA, USA","Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition","","2004","1","","480","485 Vol.1","In previous work, we showed the benefits and feasibility of having a processor dynamically partition its executing software such that critical software kernels are transparently partitioned to execute as a hardware coprocessor on configurable logic - an approach we call warp processing. The configurable logic place and route step is the most computationally intensive part of such hardware/software partitioning, normally running for many minutes or hours on powerful desktop processors. In contrast, dynamic partitioning requires place and route to execute in just seconds and on a lean embedded processor. We have therefore designed a configurable logic architecture specifically for dynamic hardware/software partitioning. Through experiments with popular benchmarks, we show that by specifically focusing on the goal of software kernel speedup when designing the FPGA architecture, rather than on the more general goal of ASIC prototyping, we can perform place and route for our architecture 50 times faster, using 10,000 times less data memory, and 1,000 times less code memory, than popular commercial tools mapping to commercial configurable logic. Yet, we show that we obtain speedups (2x on average, and as much as 4x) and energy savings (33% on average, and up to 74%) when partitioning even just one loop, which are comparable to commercial tools and fabrics. Thus, our configurable logic architecture represents a good candidate for platforms that will support dynamic hardware/software partitioning, and enables ultra-fast desktop tools for hardware/software partitioning, and even for fast configurable logic design in general.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268892","","Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic design;Software tools;Kernel;Coprocessors;Software performance;Field programmable gate arrays;Application specific integrated circuits;Software prototyping","logic partitioning;hardware-software codesign;system-on-chip;reconfigurable architectures;dynamic programming;field programmable gate arrays;just-in-time","configurable logic architecture;dynamic partitioning;processor partitioning;warp processing;hardware-software partitioning;embedded processor;software kernel;FPGA architecture;FPGA fabric;field programmable gate arrays;ASIC prototyping;system-on-chip;dynamic optimization;just-in-time compilation;reconfigurable computing;software kernels;desktop processors","","25","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a large number of objects are distributed on a distributed-memory parallel processor, referencing a remote object requires inter-processor communication. If those objects are not allocated properly, it may cause total performance degradation. When those objects are allocated with a biased distribution among the processing elements, it may cause a load imbalance. However, the information necessary for relocating objects must be obtained at run time, since the number of objects on a processor and the topology of the objects in a database are unknown at compilation time.

Furthermore, the 98% rule will only provide an upper bound for Carson's bandwidth rule. What is suggested in this paper is a more direct, simpler approach which provides both upper and lower bounds. The sideband reduction method described, is based on taking visual cues for sideband reduction levels measured with respect to the unmodulated carrier. Computations required by the method are not extensive.

First Euromicro Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","","1997","","","60","67","A flow analyzer can be very helpful in the process of program understanding, by providing the programmer with different views of the code. As the documentation is often incomplete or inconsistent, it is extremely useful to extract the information a programmer may need directly from the code. Program understanding activities are interactive, thus program analysis tools may be asked for quick answers by the maintainer. Therefore the control on the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency should be given to the user. The paper presents an approach to interprocedural reaching definitions flow analysis based on three levels of precision depending on the sensitivity to the calling context and the control flow. A lower precision degree produces an overestimate of the data dependencies in a program. The result is anyhow conservative (all dependencies which hold are surely reported), and definitely faster than the more accurate counterparts. A tool supporting reaching definition analysis in the three variants has been developed. The results on a test suite show that three orders of magnitude can be gained in execution times by the less accurate analysis, but 57.4% extra dependencies are on average added. The intermediate variant is much more precise (1.6% extra dependencies), but gains less in times (one order of magnitude).","","0-8186-7892","10.1109/CSMR.1997.583007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=583007","","Software maintenance;Flow graphs;Couplings;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing;Electric variables control;Software algorithms;Optimizing compilers;Data mining;Debugging","reverse engineering;software maintenance;data flow analysis;reachability analysis;programming;software tools","variable precision reaching definitions analysis;software maintenance;flow analyzer;program understanding;programmer;code views;documentation;information extraction;program analysis tools;efficiency;accuracy;interprocedural reaching definitions flow analysis;calling context;control flow;data dependencies;execution times","","5","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce the program context, a novel representation for comprehensive and compact control and data flow analysis information. Program contexts are described as first order logic formulas, which allows us to use public domain software for standard symbolic manipulation. Computations are represented as algebraic expressions defined over a program's problem size. Our symbolic evaluation techniques comprise accurate modeling of assignment and input/output statements, branches, loops, recurrences, arrays, and procedures. All of our techniques target both linear, as well as nonlinear, expressions and constraints. Efficiency of symbolic evaluation is highly improved by aggressive simplification techniques. A variety of examples, including program verification, dependence analysis, array privatization, communication vectorization, and elimination of redundant communication, are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.

The paper shows how custom ground support equipment was developed to facilitate software development and testing. Reliable communications between the IDS and the FUSE spacecraft bus are accomplished using a MIL-STD-1553B bus that has an imposed, deterministic real-time protocol. Similarly, communication between the IDS and the other instrument subsystems uses a second MIL-STD-1553B bus that has its own time division multiplex real-time protocol. The design of these real-time protocols is described, with particular attention to reliability and testability.","","0-7803-5749","10.1109/DASC.1999.821995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821995","","Spectroscopy;Fuses;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Programming;Software testing;Computer architecture;Hardware;Embedded software","aerospace instrumentation;ultraviolet spectroscopy;spectroscopy computing;aerospace computing;embedded systems;software architecture;system buses;computer architecture;radiation hardening (electronics);space vehicle electronics;software fault tolerance;astronomy computing;satellite telemetry","FUSE;architecture;IDS flight hardware;real-time embedded flight software;COTS software;cost;development time;radiation hardness;fault tolerance;prioritized real-time tasks;real-time operating system kernel;inter-task communication;custom ground support equipment;software development;testing;MIL-STD-1553B bus;real-time protocol;time division multiplex real-time protocol;testability;reliability","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model (test dependency graph) serves as a basis for ordering classes and methods to be tested for regression and integration purposes (minimization of test stubs). The mapping from unified modeling language to the defined model is detailed as well as the test methodology. While the complexity of optimal stub minimization is exponential with the size of the model, an algorithm is given that: computes a strategy for integration testing with a quadratic complexity in the worst case; and provides an efficient testing order for minimizing the number of stubs. Various integration strategies are compared with the optimized algorithm (a real-world case study illustrates this comparison). The results of the experiment seem to give nearly optimal stubs with a low cost despite the exponential complexity of getting optimal stubs. As being a part of a design-for-testability approach, the presented methodology also leads to the early repartition of testing resources during system integration for reducing integration duration.","0018-9529;1558-1721","","10.1109/24.855533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855533","","Object oriented modeling;System testing;Unified modeling language;Minimization methods;Software testing;Refining;Strategic planning;Cost function;Software algorithms;Charge coupled devices","software reliability;program testing;object-oriented methods","object-oriented integration;regression testing;object-oriented design;test dependency graph;unified modeling language;optimal stub minimization;quadratic complexity;integration strategies;design-for-testability approach","","59","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose the software-controlled cache architecture that improves the energy efficiency of the shared cache in an integrated multimedia system on an application-specific base. Data types in an application are allocated to different cache regions. On each access, only the allocated cache regions need to be activated.

Bryant, 1986). A new optimization technique is presented for suboptimal synthesis of ODDs of complete as well as partial multiple-output Boolean functions. The method is based on iterative decomposition. The central notion in this process is that of subfunctions, whereas in ODDs there are decision nodes. There is, however, 1:1 mapping between them: a level of decision nodes in the ODD corresponds to a set of subfunctions recognized in a corresponding decomposition step. The technique is computationally effective and deals with incomplete functions frequently used in practice. A small synthesis example is given to introduce a new technique for ROBDDs.

This system takes advantage of an unsupervised pattern classification algorithm (Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that is combined to form an optimizing control system. The GA generates a population of test patterns (individuals). Each individual is provided as a set of timed inputs to behavior based simulations representing good and faulty systems. The response of each model (good and faulty) is recombined in the form of an image matrix with each row representing a signature of each of the different circuits. FuzzyART (Fuzzy Logic Based ART) provides a method of image recognition, extracting those images that are distinctly different from any other. Each individual generated by the GA is provided as input to the list of models, then evaluated by FuzzyART and a fitness representing the number of separate classes is formed. New test sequences evolve with increasing fault isolation and detection. The process is repeated until a maximum number of models have been identified and separated. A selective breading algorithm was included to reduce the need for large populations, thus increasing the speed to converge to the ""best test"".

While FPGAs with soft processor cores provide designers with increased flexibility, such processors typically have degraded performance and energy consumption compared to hard-core processors. Previously, we proposed warp processing, a technique capable of optimizing a software application by dynamically and transparently re-implementing critical software kernels as custom circuits in on-chip configurable logic. We now study the potential of a MicroBlaze soft-core based warp processing system to eliminate the performance and energy overhead of a soft-core processor compared to a hard-core processor. We demonstrate that the soft-core based warp processor achieves average speedups of 5.8 and energy reductions of 57% compared to the soft core alone.

In the proposed method, the accuracy of desired bit rate is tunable by allocating more searching time to the encoder. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives a quality improvement of about 0.5 dB when compared to the rate control method utilized in the JM7.4 test model, with an acceptable encoder complexity.","1522-4880","0-7803-8554","10.1109/ICIP.2004.1418705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1418705","","Lagrangian functions;Automatic voltage control;Quadratic programming;Bit rate;Encoding;Optimization methods;Video coding;Rate-distortion;Software testing;Systems engineering and theory","video coding;code standards;optimisation;variable rate codes;video streaming;data compression","Lagrangian rate control algorithm;optimized rate control algorithm;H.264/AVC encoder;video coding standard;Joint Video Team;ITU-T;encoder complexity;MPEG experts;video bitstreams;Lagrangian multiplier;quantizer parameter","","7","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using data-mining application software and taking into consideration the structure of the test routine, the root cause for the degradation of the gate-oxide was found to be ILD (inter-layer-dielectric) cap oxide deposition. A matrix design of experiment was used to optimize the plasma deposition process in order to minimize charging effects by paying attention to wafer uniformity and reproducibility.

"Uncovering database access optimizations in the middle tier with TORPEDO","B. E. Martin","NA","21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'05)","","2005","","","916","926","A popular architecture for enterprise applications is one of a stateless object-based server accessing persistent data through object-relational mapping software. The reported benefits of using object-relational mapping software are increased developer productivity, greater database portability and improved runtime performance over hand-written SQL due to caching. In spite of these supposed benefits, many software architects are suspicious of the ""black box"" nature of O-R mapping software. Discerning how O-R mapping software actually accesses a database is difficult. The testbed of object relational products for enterprise distributed objects (TORPEDO) is designed to reveal the sophistication of O-R mapping software in accessing databases in single server and clustered environments. TORPEDO defines a set of realistic application level operations that detect a significant set of database access optimizations. TORPEDO supports two standard Java APIs for O-R mapping, namely, container managed persistence (CMP 2.0) and Java data objects (JDO). TORPEDO also supports the TopLink and Hibernate APIs. There are dozens of commercial and open-source O-R mapping products supporting these APIs. Results from running TORPEDO on different O-R mapping systems are comparable. We provide sample results from running TORPEDO on popular O-R mapping solutions. We describe why the optimizations TORPEDO reveals are important and how the application level operations detect the optimizations.","1063-6382;2375-026X","0-7695-2285","10.1109/ICDE.2005.149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410203","","Relational databases;Application software;Java;Computer architecture;Software performance;Productivity;Runtime;Software testing;Distributed databases;Containers","object-oriented databases;relational databases;SQL;Java;software architecture;distributed databases;public domain software","database access optimization;TORPEDO;object relational product;enterprise distributed object;object-relational mapping software;SQL;Java API;container managed persistence;Java data object","","","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Helicooptere was developed on a specific EDF solution to response to immediate needs. After 4 years of utilization, we noted an inadequate level of performance of the application, mainly due to the increasing number of web based clients and an untimely redundancy of the database Moreover, the maintenance costs are getting higher than initially foreseen and the application can't cope with the rapid evolutions of the user needs. Our work's objective was to propose several solutions for rebuilding Helicooptere with MES based data Historian software. We made two testing models based on two data Historians leaders: 1P21 (by Aspentech) and PI (by OSIsoft). Their abilities to integrate the three stages (Acquisition task, Application logic and data Publication), to interpret timestamps, to support multiple acquisition protocols, to support complex data models, and to propose a high availability and secured architecture, make the testing models so conclusive that EDF decided to rebuild Helicooptere with a data Historian.","","0-7803-8662","10.1109/ICIT.2004.1490163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1490163","","Power generation;Application software;Nuclear power generation;Research and development;Protocols;Costs;Logic testing;Electricity supply industry;Production;Prototypes","power markets;power generation economics;power transmission economics;power system analysis computing;maintenance engineering;protocols;redundancy","centralized power generation optimization center;CDF;power generating stations;real time power generation data;EDF nuclear;transmission system operator;Helicooptere;TASE.2 protocol;maintenance costs;Historian software;testing models;Historians leaders;1P21 model;PI model;interpret timestamps;multiple acquisition protocols;complex data models;secured architecture;redundancy","","3","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The optimum choice of dwell time at sensitive frequencies is an important factor when conducting the RF immunity tests to ensure repeatability. Considering the complexity of arriving at an optimum dwell time for a wide variety of electronic equipment, the general tendency may be to carry out the test with the maximum sweep rate specified in the standard. The sweep rate and corresponding dwell time chosen must be compatible with the response time of the EUT and operational modes. The inadequacy of choosing an arbitrary dwell time is highlighted in this paper.

It is shown that it is possible to extract implicit state transition graphs (ISTGs) from logic-gate and flip-flop descriptions of sequential circuits that allow equivalent states to be represented by cubes, and edges from different states to be coalesced into one, thereby decreasing significantly the CPU time and memory requirements of the extraction process. Coupled with the enumeration technique, synthesis strategies are proposed for FSMs (finite state machines) described at the logic level. As is illustrated, these synthesis strategies allow the authors to optimize large FSMs. The authors apply an ISTG traversal algorithm for verifying equivalence and detecting redundancies in logic-level sequential circuits. This algorithm is more efficient than previously developed sequential test generation algorithms when used to detect equivalent-state redundancies present in some classes of circuits.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-2055","10.1109/ICCAD.1990.129847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=129847","","Logic testing;Sequential analysis;Circuit testing;Sequential circuits;Circuit synthesis;Central Processing Unit;Application software;Flip-flops;Very large scale integration;Coupling circuits","finite automata;logic CAD;logic testing;sequential circuits","implicit state transition graphs;sequential logic synthesis;test;logic-gate;flip-flop;cubes;edges;memory requirements;finite state machines;logic-level sequential circuits","","10","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first phase updates the data-flow sets to overestimate the effect of the program change, enabling the second phase to incrementally update the affected data-flow sets to reflect the actual program change.

The aim of this work is to define a suitable criterion for the shape design optimization of HV shielding electrodes for reducing the radio interference. The experimental part of the investigation consists of standard radio interference voltage (RIV) measurements on test geometries with different sized toroidal and spherical electrodes. A detailed 3D modelling of the test geometries has been carried out using a BEM based commercial code, in order to precisely compute the electric field distribution near the electrode surfaces. It has been observed that, despite the different geometries and applied voltages, a unique electric field value is attained in all configurations in correspondence to the RIV threshold voltage. Therefore, this value can be used as a design parameter for CAE tools once the field distribution near the HV device is computed. The proposed approach may greatly improve the efficiency of HV shield design, which nowadays is normally based on empirical considerations.","","1-86043-365","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1491984","","Shape;Design optimization;Electrodes;Electromagnetic interference;Computer aided engineering;Testing;Geometry;Distributed computing;Threshold voltage;Boundary value problems","electrodes;computer aided engineering;software tools;power system CAD;electromagnetic shielding;power system protection;switchgear protection;boundary-elements methods;boundary-value problems;radiofrequency interference","shape design optimization;shielding electrodes;radio interference reduction;HV devices;computational methods;boundary value problems;CAE;computer aided engineering tools;radio interference voltage measurements;test geometries;toroidal electrodes;spherical electrodes;3D modelling;BEM based commercial code;electric field distribution;electrode surfaces;RIV threshold voltage;design parameter;HV device field distribution;HV shield design;HV switchgear","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While business processes are to be re-engineered to align with the ERP software best practices, technical architecture and infrastructure needs to be in place globally as per specifications of the packaged software. In the legacy environment, different countries or different business units use different systems, based on local standards supported by local resources. In the new ERP world, globally all the countries must conform to same technical infrastructure. Technical managers face multiple critical issues implementing a global solution. Most of the ERP software are developed in technically advanced countries, standards are often too high for under developed or developing countries. In an effort to bring the global organization to a common platform different countries needs different levels of upgrades. In this paper the authors review key technical issues faced is a global upgrade process to support a global ERP implementation and how to resolve those. We conclude although technical infrastructure and business process reengineering both are equally important and each implementation is unique, but following some simple steps it is easy to prioritize each ones during different phases of the project. Also time lines of two sub-projects must converge after initial phase and must follow a common plan for the project to be successful.

One of the main reasons to apply DT is that hopefully we need only a few numbers of projections. In many applications we have a situation where we know the material components of the object to be studied, that is, we know the discrete values of the image to be reconstructed. Using discreteness and some a priori information we can apply several DT methods in neutron imaging. Most of the DT reconstruction methods are reducing the problem to an optimization task. We tried two such methods on software and physical phantoms. In these experiments we investigated the effects of the following parameters: number of projections, noise levels, and complexity of the object to be reconstructed.

The user will thus be able to judge the sensitivity of the reliability value to any changes in the design variables. The second software, DERELOP, was conceived in an effort to rationalize the iterative process of selecting the design variables.

The traditional solution is to optimize the C library memory allocation routines. An alternative is to attack the problem on the source code level, i.e. modify the applications source code. Such an approach makes it possible to achieve more efficient and customized memory management. To implement and maintain such source code optimizations is however both laborious and costly, since it is a manual procedure. Applications developed using object-oriented techniques, such as frameworks and design patterns, tend to use a great deal of dynamic memory to offer dynamic features. These features are mainly used for maintainability reasons, and temporal locality often characterizes the run-time behavior of the dynamic memory operations. We have implemented a pre-processor based method, named Amplify, which is a completely automated procedure optimizes (object-oriented) C++ applications to exploit the temporal locality in dynamic memory usage. Test results show that Amplify can obtain significant speed-up for synthetic applications and that it was useful for a commercial product.","0190-3918","0-7695-1257","10.1109/ICPP.2001.952096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952096","","Optimization methods;Memory management;Power system management;Programming profession;Computer science;Scalability;Multiprocessing systems;Libraries;Runtime;Testing","storage management;C++ language;optimising compilers","automatic optimization;dynamic memory management;C++;memory allocator;performance;scalability;multiprocessor systems;C library memory allocation routines;source code level;customized memory management;source code optimizations;object-oriented techniques;frameworks;design patterns;dynamic memory;Amplify","","2","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many problems arise when different people work independently on their own research initiatives. These problems range from duplicating effort to, more seriously, having conflicting results. In addition, less experienced members of the group are sometimes unfamiliar with the necessary statistical methods required to properly analyse their results. These problems are not limited internally to CIRG@UP but are also prevalent in the research community at large. This proposal aims to standardise the research methodology used by CIRG@UP internally (initially in the optimisation subgroup and later in subgroups working in other paradigms of computational research).

These are respectively, the state assignment problem in the design of finite state machines, and the optimisation of combinational logic circuits using Reed-Muller (RM) techniques. When faced with such designs, the use of FPGAs to implement circuits is clearly appropriate. However, because of the limited resources available on FPGA parts, in terms of the number of available CLBs, and the increased difficulty that place and route software will experience in the layout of increasingly complex designs, it is felt that some form of optimisation of the design before implementation is still a necessary stage in the design process. This paper describes the implementation of algorithms which attempt to provide this type of optimisation for the two previously mentioned problems. The resultant software uses genetic algorithms to select, breed and test the fitness of potential solutions, and thereby recommend a near-optimal solution. In practice, these recommended solutions represent a considerable saving (in terms of gate count) on many circuit implementations, as experimental results demonstrate.<<ETX>>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=369838","","Circuit optimization;Combinational logic circuits;Field programmable gate arrays;Finite state machines;Genetic algorithms;Design automation;Minimization methods;Reed-Muller codes;State assignment","circuit optimisation;combinational circuits;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;genetic algorithms;logic CAD;minimisation of switching nets;Reed-Muller codes;state assignment","genetic algorithms;logic implementation;FPGAs;logic minimisation;state assignment problem;finite state machines;combinational logic circuits;Reed-Muller techniques;near-optimal solution;gate count","","1","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In addition to providing an ordering of classes where ripple effects are more likely, such an approach is simple and can be automated. In our investigation, we perform a thorough analysis on a commercial C++ system where change data has been collected over several years.

It is shown that by using long-term dummy locks, the need for the information about the write sets of validated transactions is eliminated and, during the validation test, only the related sites are checked. The transactions to be aborted are immediately recognized before the validation test, reducing the costs of restarts. Usual read and write locks are used as short-term locks during the validation test. The use of short-term locks in the optimistic approach eliminates the need for the system-wide critical section and results in a distributed and parallel validation test. The performance of ODL is compared with strict two-phase locking (2PL) through simulation, and it is found out that for the low conflict cases they perform almost the same, but for the high conflicting cases, ODL performs better than strict 2PL.<<ETX>>","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.83907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=83907","","Concurrency control;Distributed databases;System recovery;System testing;Costs;Optimization methods;Transaction databases;Database systems;Certification;Protocols","concurrency control;distributed databases;system recovery;transaction processing","optimistic locking technique;concurrency control;distributed databases;optimistic method;dummy locks;write sets;validated transactions;validation test;short-term locks;ODL;strict two-phase locking;low conflict cases;strict 2PL","","3","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Integrated Communication, Navigation, Identification, Avionics (ICNIA) system is considered as a model for the development. The real-time interaction of multiple functions running in the ICNIA multiprocessor system is examined. The critical importance of developing a system simulation that can provide timing and sizing data is demonstrated. If the simulation is developed early in the program, there is a valuable opportunity to keep it up to date and use it effectively in static and dynamic systems analyses.

The observation that software errors tend to form clusters (design holes) permits the use of statistical failure analysis to pinpoint the largest and most likely defective areas. It is essential to periodically halt testing and analyze the test failure data in order to optimize the use of the remaining testing resources and interval.

IPF offers a rich set of performance counters to collect detailed profile information at a low cost, which is essential to post-link optimization being practical. At the same time, the predication and bundling features on IPF make post-link code transformation more challenging than on other architectures. In Ispike, we have implemented optimizations like code layout, instruction prefetching, data layout, and data prefetching that exploit the IPF advantages, and strategies that cope with the IPF-specific challenges. Using SPEC CINT2000 as benchmarks, we show that Ispike improves performance by as much as 40% on the ltanium/spl reg/2 processor, with average improvement of 8.5% and 9.9% over executables generated by the Intel/spl reg/ Electron compiler and by the Gcc compiler, respectively.

No.00TH8510)","","2000","","","501","504","LEO communications satellite antennas may require hundreds of high gain beams to achieve sufficient link margin, especially for mobile systems where the ground terminals have very low EIRP. Generally, the procedure for optimizing antenna beams for shaped coverage areas starts with a set of polygons defined in antenna angle space. These polygons are filled with synthesis stations at which the desired gain is prescribed. An optimization program is then used to synthesize the excitation of the antenna in order to achieve the desired gain at each station. For multibeam coverages, if the number and size of the coverage polygons are not optimal, pattern performance will be poor. Layout is difficult at LEO because a large variation in cell size is dictated by the substantial path length variation from nadir to edge of coverage. A genetic algorithm was developed to optimize the number and size of cells for a circularly symmetric grid. Cells were then filled with synthesis stations and a least squares optimizer used to shape the antenna pattern for each cell. A phased array antenna with circular aperture and cos/sup 1.3//spl theta/ element power pattern was used. The genetic optimizer was found to quickly produce optimal cell layouts for arbitrary altitude, field of view, and directivity requirements. It was also a very good way to quickly and accurately determine the number of beams needed for particular set of requirements.","","0-7803-6345","10.1109/PAST.2000.859006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=859006","","Phased arrays;Low earth orbit satellites;Satellite communication;Genetic algorithms;Artificial satellites;Satellite antennas;Solids;Testing;Mobile communication;Communication system software","genetic algorithms;satellite antennas;antenna phased arrays;antenna radiation patterns;multibeam antennas;mobile satellite communication;least squares approximations;directive antennas;aperture antennas","multibeam optimization;LEO satellite communications;genetic algorithm;satellite antennas;high gain beams;link margin;mobile systems;shaped coverage areas;polygons;antenna angle space;synthesis stations;antenna excitation;optimization program;pattern performance;cell size;circularly symmetric grid;least squares optimizer;phased array antenna;circular aperture;directivity","","6","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some of the fundamental assumptions made by traditional RL algorithms are not valid for repair-based optimization. Case-based reasoning compensates for some of the limitations of traditional RL approaches. We present a case-based reasoning RL approach, implemented in the C/sub A/B/sub I/NS system, for repair-based optimization. We chose job-shop scheduling as the testbed for our approach. Our experimental results show that C/sub A/B/sub I/NS is able to effectively solve problems with changing optimization criteria which are not known to the system and only exist implicitly in a extensional manner in the case base.","1082-3409","0-8186-7312","10.1109/TAI.1995.479378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=479378","","Learning;Problem-solving;Optimization methods;Robots;Processor scheduling;Testing;Artificial intelligence;Signal processing;Search methods;Design optimization","learning by example;case-based reasoning;optimisation;scheduling;production control;software agents","case-based reasoning;reinforcement learning framework;optimization problems;job-shop scheduling;optimization criteria;repair-based frameworks;flexible computational paradigms;combinatorial optimization;case-based reasoning RL approach;CABINS system","","1","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed filtering technique consists of three modules, with different complexity levels. The contingencies are ranked in accordance with severity indices that allow assessing the influence of the overloads and voltage limit violations in the power network. The developed software package was applied to the IEEE 118 test power system. The simulation results that were produced using two different sets of security indices were compared, showing a satisfactory agreement. The simulation was carried out considering a monotonous increase of the load level as well as a random one. For the different solutions the computing times were also obtained. Finally, some conclusions that provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of the electric power system security analysis are highlighted.","","0-7803-7967","10.1109/PTC.2003.1304716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304716","","Power system simulation;Power system security;Computational modeling;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering;Voltage;Software packages;Software testing;System testing","power system analysis computing;IEEE standards;power system security;power transmission lines","contingency screening;ranking algorithm;filtering technique;power network;software package;IEEE 118 test power system;electric power system security analysis;steady-state security analysis","","3","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All of the usual difficulties associated with a distributed system are present, but are amplified by the inherent dynamics and uncertainty of the wireless network. This paper takes an agent-oriented software engineering perspective in considering how to design decentralized software systems for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) of resource-constrained devices. Specifically, the authors codify within the context of a software design pattern the concept of an agent swarm. Swarms of mobile agents have been used in the development of applications to support coordination and collaboration in a live MANET test bed. Work is underway to transition some of this technology into use by public protectors as part of the Philadelphia area urban wireless network testbed. The objectives of this paper include motivating the need for a swarm-based approach to distributed software for wireless environments and discussing the critical issues involved with mobile agents swarming on a MANET. For example, one such design issue is the selection of migration patterns for use by the swarming agents. Several different types of itinerary patterns are evaluated within the context of a mobile agent swarm.","","0-7803-9447","10.1109/MASSUR.2005.1507047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1507047","","Software design;Wireless networks;Mobile agents;Mobile ad hoc networks;Application software;Testing;Design engineering;Uncertainty;Software engineering;Software systems","mobile agents;object-oriented methods;particle swarm optimisation;ad hoc networks;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio)","decentralized software design pattern;wireless network environment;mobile agent swarm;agent-oriented software engineering;mobile ad hoc network;MANET;resource-constrained device;public protector;distributed software","","1","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digest of Papers","","1997","","","179","184","We have developed a research compiler for Java class files. The compiler, which we call Briki, is designed to test new compilation techniques. We focus on optimizations which are only possible or which are much easier to perform on a high-level intermediate representation (IR). We have designed such a representation (JavaIR) and have written a front-end which recovers high-level structure from the information from the class file. Some of the high-level optimizations can be performed by the Java compiler which produces the class file. There is, however, a set of machine-dependent optimizations which have to be customized for the specific architecture and so can only be performed when the machine code is generated from the byte codes, e.g. in a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. We choose memory hierarchy optimizations as an example of machine-dependent techniques. We show that there is an intersection of the set of machine-dependent optimizations and the set of high-level optimizations. One such example is array remapping, which requires multi-dimensional array references which are not present in the byte codes and at the same time requires information about the memory organization. We develop a set of optimizations for accessing array elements and object fields and show their impact on set of benchmarks which we run on two machines with a JIT compiler. The execution times are reduced by as much as 50%, and we argue that the improvement could be even higher with a more mature JIT technology.","1063-6390","0-8186-7804","10.1109/CMPCON.1997.584697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=584697","","Optimizing compilers;Java;Computer languages;Application software;Virtual machining;Computer science;Testing;Joining processes;Computer aided instruction;Program processors","object-oriented languages;optimising compilers;arrays;abstract data types","Briki;optimizing Java compiler;Java class files;compilation technique testing;high-level intermediate representation;JavaIR;front-end;high-level structure recovery;high-level optimizations;machine-dependent optimizations;customization;byte codes;just-in-time compiler;memory hierarchy optimizations;array remapping;multi-dimensional array references;memory organization;object fields;benchmarks","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A momentum factor is introduced into the original particle swarm optimizer to resolve this problem. Furthermore, in order to accelerate convergence, a new strategy about updating velocities is given. The resulting approach is mromentum-PSO which guarantees that particles are never beyond predefined search space without checking boundary in every iteration. In addition, linearly decreasing wight PSO (LDW-PSO) equipped with a boundary checking strategy is also discussed, which is denoted as LDWBOPSO. LDW-PSO, LDWBCPSO and momentum-PSO are compared in optimization on five test functions.

There are numerous methods addressing the array data-flow problem; however, these methods are only used in the optimization or parallelization of programs.

The latter is emphasized in major weapon-system go-ahead decisions. This paper discusses a system reliability model primarily intended to provide management insight and guidelines for identifying out-of-tolerance situations and needed corrective actions. Guidelines are discussed for judging if ``independent verification and test'' and ``weapon-system proof-of-compliance testing'' are successful. Guidelines are provided for comparing software and hardware in terms of total valid problems reported, resolution rates, and comparable difficulty of implementing and verifying the resolutions. This is done with respect to severity levels in MIL-STD-1679. The management of the operability/suitability issue is discussed and recommendations are made to both the procuring agency and the prime contractor. Software is an attractive medium in comparison to hardware in implementing complex functions because: a) there are more controllable means to reduce severe software defects, and b) it is easier to effect change. Properly managed software will have minimal difficulties with system reliability and operability/suitability. Proper software management includes: a) the application, during development, of proper design tools such as top-down design, structural programming, and programming teams; b) aggressive, independent testing and problem tracking activities; and c) application of the management elements presented in this paper. Such application requires contractor familiarity with user needs and capabilities as well as with the mission and operations of the system, so as to optimize the man/machine interface.","0018-9529;1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.1983.5221654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5221654","System software reliability;Operability/ suitability;Software management;Human factors management;User analysis;Prototyping","Software performance;Weapons;Guidelines;Application software;Reliability;Testing;Hardware;Software development management;Software systems;System performance","","","","1","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The role of the static analysis is to compute partial order information which the model checker uses to reduce the state space. During exploration, the model checker also computes aliasing information that it gives to the static analyzer which can then refine its analysis. The result of this refined analysis is then fed back to the model checker which updates its partial order reduction. At each step of this iterative process, the static analysis computes optimistic information which results in an unsafe reduction of the state space. However, we show that the process converges to a fixed point at which time the partial order information is safe and the whole state space is explored.","1938-4300","0-7695-1426","10.1109/ASE.2001.989812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989812","","State-space methods;Space exploration;Algorithm design and analysis;Information analysis;Java;Explosions;Software systems;Aerospace industry;Computer industry;Software safety","formal verification;program testing;program verification","static analysis;model checking;software analysis;iterative technique;partial order information;aliasing information;software verification","","12","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These techniques have also been applied in business, financial and economic modelling. Metaheuristics have been applied to three areas of software engineering: test data generation, module clustering and cost/effort prediction, yet there remain many software engineering problems which have yet to be tackled using metaheuristics. It is surprising that metaheuristics have not been more widely applied to software engineering; many problems in software engineering are characterised by precisely the features which make metaheuristics search applicable. In the paper it is argued that the features which make metaheuristics applicable for engineering and business applications outside software engineering also suggest that there is great potential for the exploitation of metaheuristics within software engineering. The paper briefly reviews the principal metaheuristic search techniques and surveys existing work on the application of metaheuristics to the three software engineering areas of test data generation, module clustering and cost/effort prediction. It also shows how metaheuristic search techniques can be applied to three additional areas of software engineering: maintenance/evolution system integration and requirements scheduling. The software engineering problem areas considered thus span the range of the software development process, from initial planning, cost estimation and requirements analysis through to integration, maintenance and evolution of legacy systems. The aim is to justify the claim that many problems in software engineering can be reformulated as search problems, to which metaheuristic techniques can be applied. The goal of the paper is to stimulate greater interest in metaheuristic search as a tool of optimisation of software engineering problems and to encourage the investigation and exploitation of these technologies in finding near optimal solutions to the complex constraint-based scenarios which arise so frequently in software engineering.","1462-5970","","10.1049/ip-sen:20030559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214740","","","software engineering;simulated annealing;genetic algorithms;search problems;program testing;formal specification","software engineering;search problem;metaheuristic techniques;genetic algorithms;simulated annealing;tabu search;test data generation;module clustering;cost/effort prediction;maintenance/evolution system integration;requirements scheduling;legacy systems;complex constraint-based scenarios","","59","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Today this methodology is in daily use to optimize process and products. With this in mind most DOE software's available on the market introduced since around five years ago have included the Desirability functions of Derringer (1980). Desirability functions permit the optimization simultaneously of several characteristics in the same experimental space. This first step in multi-response optimization was absolutely essential for industrial use of DOE, but this approach's weakness is that it is based on a deterministic optimization model. The provided optimum does not guarantee the robustness of the solution because it does not take into account uncertainty on factors and Response model coefficients. For this reason we are deploying at STMicroelectronics a multi-response optimization solution based on a stochastic approach of optimum's research. It takes into account uncertainty on factors and on coefficients of all the response models. The obtained solution provides a distribution function for the optimized criteria, which permits us to appreciate the statistically determined robustness. The different steps of optimization will be detailed. An example of application, for an advanced metal etch process in 0.18 /spl mu/m technology, will be presented. This permits us to point out the contribution of the stochastic solution to the process robustness and to compare it to the deterministic solution. In this example, the localization between optimums was different in the experimental space. The two solutions were tested and the physical results concluded that the better prediction was obtained with the stochastic optimum. The retained solution for industrialization was obviously the stochastic optimum.","","0-7803-7158","10.1109/ASMC.2002.1001601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1001601","","Robustness;Design optimization;Design for experiments;Microelectronics;Stochastic processes;US Department of Energy;Uncertainty;Space technology;Optimization methods;Distribution functions","optimisation;semiconductor process modelling;stochastic processes;sputter etching;design of experiments","robust process optimization;experimental design;microelectronics processing;stochastic method;desirability function;multi-response optimization;response model;distribution function;metal etching;0.18 micron","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Truth data systems can be costly and difficult to transport. The Volpe Center was tasked with rapidly designing and developing a portable suite of equipment to simulate a taxiing, takeoff roll or landing rollout aircraft and provide truth data. The design concept for the portable airport surveillance verification system (PASVS) required that the unit be portable, easily deployed in a government or rental vehicle, and intuitive to operate. A modular design was selected for the PASVS consisting primarily of an integrated aircraft VHF radio, a differential global positioning system receiver, two aviation transponders (an air traffic control radar beacon system-only transponder and a mode S transponder) and a computer with data logging software. The PASVS has shown to be a capable platform for simulating a taxiing, takeoff or landing rollout aircraft and for providing ground truth data to evaluate airport surface surveillance systems. PASVS also demonstrated its ability to be easily and quickly shipped to various continental U.S. and overseas locations and be rapidly installed and easily operated from any ground vehicle by a single operator with minimal training. In this paper, the requirements and design processes are described and PASVS performance data is presented along with collected sample truth data.","","0-7803-7844","10.1109/DASC.2003.1245842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5731092","","","Global Positioning System;VHF radio propagation;air traffic control;aircraft computers;airports;data loggers;optimisation;portable instruments;transponders","Volpe Center;acceptance testing;air traffic control radar;airport surface surveillance system;aviation transponders;data logging software;differential global positioning system receiver;integrated aircraft VHF radio;landing rollout aircraft;mode S transponder;modular design;optimization;portable airport surveillance verification system;portable avionics test suite;portable suite;radar beacon system-only transponder;takeoff roll;taxiing simulation;truth data systems","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two efforts aim to improve the efficiency of scientific computation on clusters through resource-aware dynamic load balancing. The popularity of cost-effective clusters built from commodity hardware has opened up a new platform for the execution of software originally designed for tightly coupled supercomputers. Because these clusters can be built to include any number of processors ranging from fewer than 10 to thousands, researchers in high-performance scientific computation at smaller institutions or in smaller departments can maintain local parallel computing resources to support software development and testing, then move the software to larger clusters and supercomputers. As promising as this ability is, it has also led to the need for local expertise and resources to set up and maintain these clusters. The software must execute efficiently both on smaller local clusters and on larger ones. These computing environments vary in the number of processors, speed of processing and communication resources, and size and speed of memory throughout the memory hierarchy as well as in the availability of support tools and preferred programming paradigms. Software developed and optimized using a particular computing environment might not be as efficient when it's moved to another one. In this article, we describe a small cluster along with two efforts to improve the efficiency of parallel scientific computation on that cluster. Both approaches modify the dynamic load-balancing step of an adaptive solution procedure to tailor the distribution of data across the cooperating processes. This modification helps account for the heterogeneity and hierarchy in various computing environments.","1521-9615;1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2005.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1401801","cluster computing;grid computing;resource-aware computing;dynamic load balancing;heterogeneous clusters","Supercomputers;Concurrent computing;Load management;Hardware;Software design;Parallel processing;Programming;Software testing;Software maintenance;Availability","workstation clusters;resource allocation;software engineering;program testing;distributed processing","resource-aware scientific computation;heterogeneous cluster;supercomputers;resource-aware dynamic load balancing;parallel computing;software development;software testing","","13","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

From the review results, a few lessons are learned. First, defects which had not been found in the test stage of PMS development could be detected in this code review. These are hidden defects that affect system quality and that are difficult to find in the test. If the defects found in this code review had been fixed before the test stage of PMS development, productivity and quality enhancement of the project would have been improved. Second, manual review takes much longer than an automated one. In this code review, general check items were checked by automation tool, while project-specific ones were checked by manual method. If project-specific check items could also be checked by automation tool, code review and verification work after fixing the defects would be conducted very efficiently. Reflecting on this idea, an evolution model of code review is studied, which eventually seeks fully automated review as an optimized code review.","","0-7695-2296","10.1109/ICIS.2005.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1515372","","Inspection;Software engineering;Security;Testing;Automation;Project management;Code standards;Software standards;Standards development;Communication standards","project management;software development management;program verification;software quality;software standards;software performance evaluation;computer science education","automated code review;manual code review;studio project;project management system;software engineering;development standard;design rule;naming rule;system quality;PMS development;PMS productivity;quality enhancement;automation tool;project-specific check item;verification work","","3","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Tradeoffs in synthetic instrument design and application","J. Fleagle","Syst. & Electron. Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA","IEEE Autotestcon, 2005.","","2005","","","166","170","There are efforts underway within industry to develop synthetic instrumentation (SI) as a complement to traditional monolithic instrumentation designs. This provides flexibility in the selection of SI components to match the performance level required and to also overcome obsolescence issues. The synthetic instrument concept is attractive because signal processing and generation can be handled by platform independent software routines. The capability of an instrument can be changed or extended by simply down loading a new program or upgrading a driver. Common programming standards such as IVI can simplify transitioning to replacement hardware and software when obsolescence becomes an issue. With the explosion in personal computer development, processing power has become an inexpensive commodity. A/D and D/A converters are becoming commodities as well, with increasing speed and resolution every year. Signal conditioning remains a custom element as it usually must be tailored for specific applications. Leveraging COTS hardware and software can reduce cost and shorten system development times. As with any new concept, application of synthetic instrument raises issues that must be considered. Synthetic instruments impact overall test system architecture. The impact depends on the complexity of synthetic instrument function and where the signal processing functionality (software) is located. Emulation of legacy instrumentation is another issue. Since the SI measurement processes used are typically different from the legacy instrument, the synthetic instrument may not perfectly emulate the legacy device. For military test systems where longevity and user maintainability are prime requirements, the logistics tail must be considered. Development cycles for military test equipment are long by commercial standards. The world of COTS changes rapidly and it is not uncommon for COTS technology to be obsolete before the system is fielded. Another concern is environmental standards. Military systems typically have stringent requirements for shock, vibration, temperature, humidity, EMI/EMC, and other environmental requirements that commercial systems are not required to meet. This paper examines some of these issues related to synthetic instrumentation. As always with engineering, there is no perfect answer, there are only tradeoffs to be optimized","1088-7725;1558-4550","0-7803-9101","10.1109/AUTEST.2005.1609121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609121","","Instruments;Signal processing;Hardware;Application software;System testing;Military standards;Signal generators;Software standards;Explosions;Microcomputers","automatic test equipment;military equipment;signal processing","synthetic instrument design;synthetic instrumentation;monolithic instrumentation design;programming standards;A/D converters;D/A converters;signal conditioning;COTS hardware;COTS software;signal processing functionality;SI measurement processes;legacy instrument;military test systems;military test equipment;environmental standards","","5","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present two novel pre-processing steps for code compression that explore program binaries' syntax and semantics to achieve superior compression ratios. The first preprocessing step involves heuristic partitioning of a program binary into streams with high auto-correlation. The second preprocessing step uses code optimization via instruction rescheduling in order to improve prediction probabilities for a given compression engine. We have developed three heuristics for instruction rescheduling that explore tradeoffs of the solution quality versus algorithm run-time. The pre-processing steps are integrated with the generic paradigm of prediction by partial matching (PPM) which is the basis of our compression codec. The compression algorithm is implemented for x86 binaries and tested on several large Microsoft applications. Binaries compressed using our compression codec are 18-24% smaller than those compressed using the best available off-the-shelf compressor.","","0-7695-1913","10.1109/CGO.2003.1191555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191555","","Compression algorithms;Codecs;Application software;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer science;Software performance;System performance;Autocorrelation;Engines","optimising compilers;codecs;network operating systems;data compression","code optimization;code compression;software delivery platforms;Microsoft NET;system parameter;system performance;pre-processing steps;program binaries;compression ratios;preprocessing step;heuristic partitioning;high auto-correlation;instruction rescheduling;prediction probabilities;compression engine;prediction by partial matching;PPM;compression codec;compression algorithm;large Microsoft applications;off-the-shelf compressor","","1","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When documents are produced, they tend to follow no defined standard and lack information that is crucial to make them understandable and usable by developers and maintainers. Then a fundamental practical question, which motivated this keynote address, is to better understand what type of documentation is required, what is needed to support its completeness and consistency, and what is the level of precision required for each type of document.

A genetic algorithm is developed and its performance compared with alternative stochastic optimisation techniques: random search, multistart and simulated annealing. The problem of fully reducing all tables in a tree query is used to compare the techniques. For this problem, evaluating the fitness function is an expensive operation. The proposed GA uses a tree-structured data model with tailored crossover and mutation operators that avoid the need to fully re-evaluate the fitness function for new solutions. Query optimisation is a task that must be performed in real-time. A technique is required that performs well at the start of a search, but avoids the problem of premature convergence. The proposed GA uses a local search phase to deliver the required real-time performance. Experiments show that the proposed GA can perform better than the alternative techniques tested.

This paper proposes using existing branch handling hardware to generate profile information in real time. Techniques are presented for both one-level and two-level branch hardware organizations. The approach produces high accuracy with small slowdown in execution (0.4%-4.6%). This allows a program to be profiled while it is used, eliminating the need for a test input suite.

(1996, 1998) for the purposes of call graph construction for C programs with function pointers. The analysis is implemented in the context of a production-strength code-browsing tool from Siemens Corporate Research. The analysis uses an inexpensive, almost-linear flow- and context-insensitive algorithm. To measure analysis precision, we compare the call graph computed by the analysis with the most precise call graph obtainable by a large category of pointer analyses. Surprisingly, for all our data programs the analysis of Zhang et al. achieves the best possible precision. This result indicates that for the purposes of call graph construction, even inexpensive analyses can provide very good precision, and therefore the use of more expensive analyses may not be justified.","","0-7695-1793","10.1109/SCAM.2002.1134115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1134115","","Software tools;Productivity;Software testing;Information analysis;Computer science;Algorithm design and analysis;Data analysis;Optimizing compilers;Software engineering;Costs","reverse engineering;program testing;system monitoring","precise call graph construction;function pointers;software productivity tools;software understanding;software restructuring;software testing;indirect memory accesses;pointer dereferences;indirect procedure calls;C programs;production strength code browsing tool;context-insensitive algorithm;flow-insensitive algorithm;analysis precision","","3","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new algorithm, called MDQL, considers a family of agents for each objective function involved in a MOOP. Each agent proposes a solution for its corresponding objective function. Agents leave traces while they construct solutions considering traces made by other agents. The solutions proposed by the agents are evaluated using a non-domination criterion and solutions in the final Pareto set for each iteration are rewarded. A mechanism for the application of MDQL in continuous spaces which considers a fixed set of possible actions for the states (the number of actions depends on the dimensionality of the MOOP), is also proposed. Each action represents a path direction and its magnitude is changed dynamically depending on the evaluation of the state that the agent reached. Constraint handling, based on reinforcement comparison, considers reference values for constraints, penalizing agents violating any of them proportionally to the violation committed. MDQL performance was measured with ""error ratio"" and ""spacing"" metrics on four test bed problems suggested in the literature, showing competitive results with state-of-the-art algorithms.","","0-7803-6375","10.1109/CEC.2000.870294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=870294","","Learning;Testing;Pareto optimization;Optimization methods;Autonomous agents;State estimation;Evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;multi-agent systems;constraint handling;software performance evaluation","distributed reinforcement learning;multiple objective optimization problems;performance evaluation;MDQL;software agents;nondomination criterion;Pareto set;constraint handling;error ratio;spacing metrics","","2","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It consists of algorithms based on information theory, heuristic search, and graph theory to optimize design, diagnosis and maintenance of integrated systems and thereby reduce the life-cycle cost. A system is modeled as a hierarchical directed dependency graph with special nodes to denote modules, test points, modes of operation and redundancy. Links in the graph denote first order functional dependencies. TEAMS supports hierarchical testing in accordance with the field maintenance procedures; a failure source may be isolated to a component or a module at any level. Other practical features include options to integrate diagnosis with rectification, and to optimize diagnostic time and/or cost. An interactive menu-mouse graphical interface serves as a high-level front-end to these algorithms and enables the user to graphically enter, modify and integrate hierarchical functional models of systems. TEAMS presents concise testability reports consisting of important detection and isolation figures of merit, testability shortcomings and design for testability recommendations.","","0-7803-1783","10.1109/ACC.1994.752424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=752424","","System testing;Systems engineering and theory;Automatic testing;Software testing;Design for testability;Cost function;Design engineering;Software packages;Information theory;Graph theory","design for testability;CAD;maintenance engineering;software packages;information theory;heuristic programming;graph theory;graphical user interfaces","TEAMS;Testability Engineering and Maintenance System;software package;testability analysis;automatic test sequencing;design-for-testability;complex hierarchically-described modular systems;information theory;heuristic search;graph theory;life-cycle cost reduction;hierarchical directed dependency graph;CAD;test points;operation modes;redundancy;functional dependencies;hierarchical testing;field maintenance procedures;rectification","","26","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The information is typically in the form of tests, or questions about the system. Each test can potentially reduce our uncertainty about the system's state. The problem is to represent the information capturing the dependence between tests, their outcomes, and possible states in an efficiently navigable way to aid diagnosis. The most common such representation is a flowchart with leaf nodes corresponding to possible states, and non-leaf nodes corresponding to tests about the state. The problem with flowcharts is that they are notoriously difficult to maintain. Additional knowledge often has to be manually integrated as the system changes, making it impossible to keep track of all possible decision paths, let alone optimize the flow to maximize performance. We propose an efficient method for optimizing an existing flowchart based on a conversion to an auxiliary matrix representation. The main goal of the paper is show a synergy between the two representations in the hope that this will help practitioners choose a better strategy for their applications. We show that such a conversion suggests ways to improve both representations - ways that were not envisioned when using each representation alone. Finally, we show that the two representations are informationally equivalent in the sense that one can be transformed into the other so that if both are used as black-boxes, one would not be able to tell them apart, regardless of which state the system is in.","1573-0077","0-7803-9087","10.1109/INM.2005.1440825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440825","","System testing;Flowcharts;Medical tests;Performance evaluation;Uncertainty;Optimization methods;Navigation;Information retrieval;Databases;Medical diagnosis","flowcharting;program diagnostics;program testing;tree data structures;software management","test-based diagnosis;tree representations;flowchart;nonleaf nodes;auxiliary matrix representation","","2","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These machines are capable of placing over 15,000 components per hour, thereby reducing PWB manufacturing cost. However, it is necessary to simultaneously optimize feeder set-up, nozzle set-up and placement sequence for the fastest placement rate to be achieved. This paper addresses development of optimization software for the Fuji NP-132, a dual station, dual revolver head, high-speed placement machine. Following a description of machine operation, a set of equations is derived for evaluation of total assembly time for a given board, based on the pick-place times of individual revolver head cycles. Feeder, nozzle and placement optimization problems are discussed in terms of the machine's degrees of freedom and physical constraints. An adaptive simulated annealing algorithm is proposed. Cheapest insertion and nearest neighbor path construction heuristics are used to generate placement sequences, while constraint satisfaction swapping heuristics are used to generate feeder and nozzle set-ups. This hybrid technique has the advantages of stochastic search for a global optimum and guided search which guarantees the feasibility of a solution, i.e. the feeder set-up fits in the machine's feeder bank and contains all parts required for the PWB.

Quite often, there is little documentation describing a software system's architecture, especially in the case of legacy software systems. Thus techniques must be employed for recovering the architecture from the software's source code. Given the size and complexity of legacy systems, researchers have started exploring the use of automated techniques for architecture recovery. A technique that has shown promising results is clustering. Clusters that are obtained as a result of the clustering process represent sub-systems within a software system, but are nor easy to interpret until they are given appropriate names. In this paper, we present a cluster labeling scheme based on identifiers. As the clustering process proceeds, keywords are ranked using the inverse document frequency ranking scheme. Results of experiments conducted on a test system demonstrate that our labeling approach is effective.

To provide a simple and objective solution to identify whether grain are moldy, a smell analyzing system of grain quality is developed. The system consists of gas sensor array, gas pipe system, signal adjusting circuit, data collecting system and pattern recognition system. The software is developed on the basis of Visual Basic 6.0 and Matlab 6.5. In order to improve veracity of identification, three eigenvalues in the collecting data are used, one is the maximal response point, the other two are near the maximal response point. The sample eigenvalues are trained with the triplex-optimize BP NN. By testing, both training samples and test samples can be identified correctly, which indicates that the application of neural networks is valuable in the smell analyzing system of grain quality.","","0-7803-8273","10.1109/WCICA.2004.1342071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342071","","Neural networks;Sensor arrays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;System testing;Animals;Gas detectors;Circuits;Pattern recognition;Software systems;Visual BASIC","neural nets;agricultural products;backpropagation;BASIC;visual languages;digital simulation;optimisation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;statistical testing","BP neural networks;smell analysing system;grain quality;moldy grain;gas sensor array;gas pipe system;signal adjusting circuit;data collecting system;pattern recognition system;Visual Basic 6.0;Matlab 6.5;triplex optimization;maximal response point;eigenvalues","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Function parameters are encoded as floating-point variables and mutated with a simple arithmetic operation. During mutation, a variable-length, one-way crossover operation splices perturbed best-so-far parameter values into existing population vectors. A novel sampling technique adaptively scales the step-size of perturbations as the population evolves. DE's selection criterion demands that improved vectors always be accepted. The performance of DE on a testbed of 15 functions is compared with a variety of recently published results encompassing many different methods. DE converged for all 15 functions and was the fastest method for solving 11 of them. DE's performance on the remaining 4 functions was competitive.","","0-7803-3225","10.1109/NAFIPS.1996.534790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=534790","","Genetic mutations;Design optimization;Evolutionary computation;Floating-point arithmetic;Constraint optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Sampling methods;Testing;Hardware;Software performance","genetic algorithms;functional analysis;arithmetic;convergence of numerical methods","differential evolution;numerical optimizer;evolutionary algorithm;real-valued multi-modal functions;function parameter encoding;floating-point variables;arithmetic operation;variable-length one-way crossover operation;perturbed best-so-far parameter values;population vectors;sampling technique;adaptive step-size scaling;selection criterion;performance","","133","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting with a standard cell library and a simple circuit connectivity description, the program performs various automatic and/or interactive procedures such as initial placement, assignment of equivalent and equipotential pins, optimization of the placement, prerouting, routing, routing compression, fan in fan out and crosstalk verification and circuit verification. The database has reentrant properties such that a designer can step through the system and try out different possibilities. After each step the results are immediately available and can be compared with previous outputs. This on-line optimization avoids multiple rerunning of the task and will also yield a better chip minimization. CALMOS is written in standard FORTRAN and only needs 32K (16 bit) of memory (300 cell version) together with simple overlay facilities. As a result it can easily be installed on almost any existing computersystem. Because of this portability, the algorithmic strength and the modularity of CALMOS is successfully combined with the on-line interactive facilities of existing graphic systems. Such an integration which is actually under development, will allow for the creation of a stand alone integrated minicomputer based LSI design system. It will be based on a common design language and include logic simulation, layout, circuit analysis, design rule checking, logic verification and test pattern generation.","","","10.1109/DAC.1979.1600095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1600095","","Software systems;Large scale integration;Logic design;Logic circuits;Logic testing;Software libraries;Pins;Crosstalk;Databases;Minimization","","","","8","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An analytical method for synthesizing a predistortion network that decouples the amplitude and phase responses of the cavity is also outlined.

A main feature of WS group testing is that it is able to establish the test oracles for the given test inputs from multiple WS and infer the oracles by plural voting. Efficient voting of complex and large number of data is critical to the success of group testing. Current voting techniques are not designed to deal with such a situation. This paper presents efficient voting algorithms that determine the plural value on multi-dimensional data and large number of data.

The end-goal is to minimize the hardware area, subject to architectural and performance constraints. This is an NP-complete problem; we present an efficient heuristic called MIBS to solve it. The MIBS (Mapping and Implementation-Bin Selection) algorithm solves the extended partitioning problem by decomposing it into an iterative process consisting of two steps: mapping and implementation-bin selection (IBS). The GCLP (Global Criticality/Local Phase-driven) algorithm computes a mapping by using an adaptive optimization objective at each iteration. This objective is selected on the basis of a global time criticality measure and local optimality measures. The IBS algorithm solves the implementation-bin selection problem. It uses a bin sensitivity measure which correlates the implementation bin motion with the overall hardware area reduction, to determine the implementation bin of a node for a given mapping. Experimental results indicate that the added dimension of design flexibility (offered by implementation bins) can be used effectively in partitioning to reduce the overall area. The MIBS algorithm has O(|N|/sup 3/) complexity, with a solution quality comparable to that of ILP (integer linear programming).","1074-6005","0-8186-7100","10.1109/IWRSP.1995.518565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=518565","","Hardware;Partitioning algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Time measurement;Software algorithms;NP-complete problem;Area measurement;Motion measurement;Software quality;Design optimization","directed graphs;minimisation;computational complexity;logic CAD;software engineering;resource allocation;iterative methods;logic partitioning","extended partitioning problem;hardware/software mapping;implementation-bin selection;precedence graph node mapping;node implementation selection;hardware area reduction;architectural constraints;performance constraints;NP-complete problem;MIBS heuristic algorithm;iterative process;GCLP algorithm;global criticality;local phase-driven algorithm;adaptive optimization objective;global time criticality measure;local optimality measures;bin sensitivity measure;implementation bin motion;design flexibility;complexity;solution quality","","27","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system has also made it possible to add challenging parts to each project, such as optimization and testing, and it has enabled students to meet these challenges. Finally, the system has reduced the grading load of University of Michigan's large classes significantly and helped the instructors handle the rapidly increasing enrollments of the 1990s. Initial experience with the feedback system showed that students depended too heavily on the feedback system as a substitute for their own testing. This problem was addressed by requiring students to submit a comprehensive test suite along with their program and by applying automated feedback techniques to help students learn how to write good test suites.

Model two considers two RB in conversation: both blocks must satisfy their respective acceptance tests before any of the blocks are allowed to exit from the conversation. Simple expressions for the reliability of the system are derived for models 1 and 2, and it is proved for them that the reliability of a RB consisting of versions ordered from smallest to largest based on failure probability is as reliable as any other list of the versions.

It has been shown that cache misses are not evenly distributed throughout a program. In applications running on RISC-style processors, a small number of delinquent load instructions are responsible for most of the cache misses. Identification of delinquent loads is the key to the success of many cache optimization and prefetching techniques. We propose a method for identifying delinquent loads that can be implemented at compile time. Our experiments over eighteen benchmarks from the SPEC suite shows that our proposed scheme is stable across benchmarks, inputs, and cache structures, identifying an average of 10% of the total number of loads in the benchmarks we tested that account for over 90% of all data cache misses. As far as we know, this is the first time a technique for static delinquent load identification with such a level of precision and coverage has been reported. While comparable techniques can also identify load instructions that cover 90% of all data cache misses, they do so by selecting over 50% of all load instructions in the code, resulting in a high number of false positives. If basic block profiling is used in conjunction with our heuristic, then our results show that it is possible to pin down just 1.3% of the load instructions that account for 82% of all data cache misses.","","0-7695-2102","10.1109/CGO.2004.1281683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281683","","Benchmark testing;Computer science;Prefetching;Application software;Optimizing compilers;Parallel processing;Hardware;Computer aided instruction;Runtime;Robustness","cache storage;optimising compilers;reduced instruction set computing;memory architecture;benchmark testing;resource allocation","static delinquent load identification;processor cache misses;RISC-style processors;delinquent load instructions;cache optimization;prefetching technique;SPEC suite benchmark;basic block profiling","","6","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such architectures comprise two or more processors (often a mix of general purpose and digital signal processors) together with a rich peripheral mix to provide a high performance computational platform. While there are many simulation solutions in the industry available to address the system partitioning issues and also the verification of HW-SW interactions in these complex systems, there are very few solutions targetted towards the SW application developers' needs. The primary concern of the SW application developers is to debug and optimize their code. Hence, cycle accuracy and performance of the simulation solution becomes the key enablers. Desired observability and controllability of the models are additional careabouts. Secondly, application developers are more comfortable at instruction level simulations than they are with RTL or gate level simulation. These specific requirements have a bearing on the choices in the simulation solutions. This paper describes the design of a generic, C based multi-processor instruction set simulator framework in the context of the above parameters. This framework, termed the ""simulation bridge"", facilitates highly accurate, yet efficient simulation. The SimBridge performs clock correct lock-step simulation of the models in the architecture using a global simulation engine that handles both intra-processor and inter-processor communication in a homogenous fashion. It addresses the multiple key issues of execution control, synchronization, connectivity and communication. The paper concludes with the performance analysis of the SimBridge in an experimental test setup as well as in the Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320C54x-based simulators.","","1-58113-542","10.1145/774789.774800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003600","","Bridges;Computational modeling;Embedded computing;Computer architecture;Digital signal processors;Computer peripherals;High performance computing;Observability;Controllability;Context modeling","multiprocessing systems;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;performance evaluation;digital simulation;program debugging","Simulation Bridge;multi-processor simulation framework;embedded systems;system partitioning;HW-SW interactions verification;software debug;observability;controllability;instruction level simulations;gate level simulation;C based multi-processor instruction set simulator framework;SimBridge;performance analysis;TMS320C54x-based simulators","","6","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, the program can test the network on several safety requirements (like contact voltage) and it enables the user to modify the network in order to meet these requirements. As the program is to be used by people who are not familiar with computers, attention is payed to user-friendliness.

Consequently, we witness an unprecedented proliferation of embedded/mobile applications. Most of the environments that execute these applications have severe power, performance, and memory space constraints that need to be accounted for. In particular, memory limitations can present serious challenges to embedded software designers. The current solutions to this problem include sophisticated packaging techniques and code optimizations for effective memory utilization. While the first solution is not scalable, the second one is restricted by intrinsic data dependences in the code that prevent code restructuring. In this paper, we explore an alternate approach for reducing memory space requirements of embedded applications. The idea is to re-compute the result of a code block (potentially multiple times) instead of storing it in memory and performing a memory operation whenever needed. The main benefit of this approach is that it reduces memory space requirements, that is, no memory space is reserved for storing the result of the code block in question.","1530-1591;1558-1101","0-7695-2288","10.1109/DATE.2005.285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395725","","Application software;Space technology;Embedded software;Packaging;Data structures;Computer science;Mobile computing;Memory management;Software design;Embedded system","embedded systems;optimisation;storage management;software engineering","storage-recomputation tradeoffs;memory-constrained embedded processing;consumer convenience;embedded technology;mobile lifestyles;embedded mobile applications;power constraints;performance constraints;memory space constraints;embedded software design;packaging techniques;code optimization;memory utilization;intrinsic data dependences;code restructuring;code block result re-computation;memory operation","","6","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The mapping from UML to the defined model is detailed as well as the test methodology. While the complexity of optimal stub minimization is exponential with the size of the model, an algorithm which computes a strategy for integration testing with a quadratic complexity is detailed. This algorithm provides an efficient testing order for minimizing the number of stubs. A comparison is given of various integration strategies with the proposed optimized algorithm (a real-world case study illustrates this comparison).

The purpose is to compare the predictive merit of competing software reliability models, an important concern to software reliability analysts. This technique calculates the Bayes probability of how much better the prediction accuracy is for one method relative to a competitor. This novel approach is more realistic, in the assessment of predictive merit, than (a) comparing merely the average values of ARE and SqRE as conventionally done; and (b) conducting statistical hypothesis tests of pair-wise means of ARE and SqRE, an approach somewhat more sensible than (a), because (b) incorporates variability of predicted values, which (a) does not. To implement this technique, first noninformative (across the border) are used and then informative (specified) priors. For the informative case, half-normal priors are placed on the mean of the ARE or SqRE random variables, because these means are hypothesized to remain peaked around zero relative-error (ideal error percentage). This problem is related to the general problem of ranking usual means discussed in the literature by Berger and Deely (1988), and is a follow-up to an invited research paper presented at ISI-97 by Sahinoglu and Capar (1997).","0018-9529;1558-1721","","10.1109/24.935022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935022","","Stochastic processes;Predictive models;Software reliability;Random variables;Software measurement;Maximum likelihood estimation;Testing;Statistics;Digital arithmetic;Particle measurements","software reliability;Bayes methods;probability;stochastic processes","stochastic Bayes measures;forecast accuracy;software-reliability models;absolute relative error;squared relative error;random variables;estimated software failures;predictive merit;Bayes probability;noninformative priors;informative priors;zero relative-error;ideal error percentage","","11","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Additionally, we propose a new technique called hierarchical identification of parallelism (HIP), which is a systematic approach to identify parallelism. Using this technique, an optimizing compiler can obtain a better static schedule of the assembly level instructions.

This architecture is called a Virtual Test Bench (VTB) for Integrated Diagnostics. The VTB approach addresses design for testability, safety, and risk reduction because it provides an engineering environment to develop/provide: 1. Accurate, comprehensive, and graphical model based failure mode, effects and diagnostic analysis to understand failure modes, their propagation, effects, and ability of diagnostics to address these failure modes. 2. Optimization of diagnostic methods and test sequencing supporting the development of an effective mix of diagnostic methods. 3. Seamless integration from analysis, to run-time implementation, to maintenance process and life cycle support. undetected fault lists, ambiguity group lists, and optimized diagnostic trees. 4. A collaborative, widely distributed engineering environment to ""ring-out"" the design before it is built and flown. The VTB architecture offers an innovative solution in a COTS package for system/component modeling, design for safety, failure mode/effect analysis, testability engineering, and rigorous integration/testing of the IVHM (Integrated Vehicle Health Management) function with the rest of the vehicle. The VTB approach described in this paper will use the TEAMS software tool to generate detailed, accurate ""failure"" models of the design, assess the propagation of the failure mode effects, and determine the impact on safety, mission and support costs. It will generate FMECA, mission reliability assessments, incorporate the diagnostic and prognostic test designs, and perform testability analysis.

However, in reality even slices of small programs are often too large to be useful. Imprecise pointer analyses have been suggested as one cause of this problem. In this paper, we use dynamic points-to data, which represents optimistic pointer information, to obtain a bound on the best case slice size improvement that can be achieved with improved pointer precision. Our experiments show that slice size can be reduced significantly for programs that make frequent use of calls through function pointers because for them the dynamic pointer data results in a considerably smaller call graph, which leads to fewer data dependences. Programs without or with only few calls through function pointers, however, show considerably less improvement. We discovered that C programs appear to have a significant fraction of direct and nonspurious pointer data dependences so that reducing spurious dependences via pointers is only of limited benefit. Consequently, to make slicing useful in general for such programs, improvements beyond better pointer analyses are necessary. On the other hand, since we show that collecting dynamic function pointer information can be performed with little overhead (average slowdown of 10 percent for our benchmarks), dynamic pointer information may be a practical approach to making slicing of programs with frequent function pointer use more successful in practice.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2005.94","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498771","Index Terms- Dynamic analysis;points-to analysis;program slicing.","Data analysis;Computer Society;Application software;Programming profession;Debugging;Software maintenance;Software testing;Reverse engineering;Computer languages;Information analysis","program slicing;reverse engineering;software cost estimation","program slicing;optimistic pointer information;function pointers;call graph;data dependences;C programs;dynamic function pointer information;dynamic points-to set analysis;program understanding","","20","61","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Dhall's effect is avoided by dividing the tasks in two priority classes based on task utilization: heavy and light. We prove that if the load on the multiprocessor server stays below U/sub threshold/ = 3 - /spl radic/7 = 35.425%, the server can accept incoming aperiodic tasks and guarantee that the deadlines of all accepted tasks will be met. 35.425% utilization is also a threshold for a task to be characterized as heavy. The bound U/sub threshold/ = 3 - /spl radic/7 = 35.425% is easy-to-use, but not sharp if we know the number of processors in the multiprocessor. For a server with m processors, we calculate a formula for the sharp bound U/sub threshold/(m), which converges to Uthreshold from above as m - -. The results are based on a utilization function u/sub m/(x) = 2(1 - x)/(2 + /spl radic/(2 + 2x)) + x/m. By using this function, the performance of the multiprocessor can in some cases be improved beyond U/sub threshold/ (m) by paying the extra overhead of monitoring the individual utilization of the current tasks.","1545-3421","0-7695-1956","10.1109/RTTAS.2003.1203049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203049","","Processor scheduling;Delay;Admission control;Software engineering;Computer science;Software testing;Monitoring;Real time systems","processor scheduling;computational complexity;real-time systems","multiprocessor scheduling;time-independent priority;multiprocessor server","","5","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our extensions to Rotor include a low overhead run-time-stack based sampling profiler that identifies program hotspots. At the first level of optimisation, the compiler uses a fast yet effective linear scan algorithm for register allocation. Hot methods can be instrumented to collect basic-block, edge and call-graph profile information. Profile-guided optimisations driven by online profile information are used to further optimise heavily executed methods at the second level of recompilation. An evaluation of the framework using a set of test programs shows that performance can improve by a maximum of 42.3% and by 9% on average. Our results also show that the overheads of collecting accurate profile information through instrumentation to an extent outweigh the benefits of profile-guided optimisations in our implementation, suggesting the need for implementing techniques that can reduce such overheads. A flexible and extensible framework design implies that additional profiling and optimisation techniques can easily be incorporated to further improve performance.","1462-5970","","10.1049/ip-sen:20030986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249340","","","optimising compilers;software performance evaluation;program control structures","dynamic recompilation;profile-guided optimisations;NET JIT compiler;adaptive recompilation framework;Rotor;shared source implementation;common language infrastructure;program performance;CLI;low overhead sampling profiler;run-time-stack based sampling profiler;program hotspots;optimisation;compiler;linear scan algorithm;register allocation;basic-block information;edge information;call-graph profile information;accurate profile information","","1","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Evolutionary algorithms have already been successfully used for execution-time analysis under the traditional procedural development paradigm. This paper describes a first attempt in making search-based execution-time analysis techniques also applicable under the more recent object-oriented and component-based software development paradigms. Here, their application is more difficult compared with the traditional procedural development approaches because object-based architectures are inherently encapsulated, and they often represent state machines. This work proposes a solution that makes search techniques applicable in real-time system development with object technology. It is based on built-in testing artefacts and on the execution and optimization of an object's invocation history through a genetic algorithm.

We show an approach designed to reduce the response time of rule-based expert systems by reducing the matching time. There are two steps in the method we propose: The first makes an index structure of the tokens to reduce the /spl alpha/-node-level join candidates. The second chooses the highest time tag for certain /spl beta/-nodes to reduce the amount of combinatorial match that is problematical in a real-time production system application.

"System on silicon, Where are we?","J. Borel","Central Res. & Dev., SGS-Thomson, France","Proceedings of 14th VLSI Test Symposium","","1996","","","XXVI","","Since the early 70's, chip complexity has been continuously growing at a rate that has never slowed down, targeting the gigabit complexities for DRAM around the year 2000. The consequences of such an evolution in the year 1996, is the capability to put several hundred kilobytes of memory on a single microprocessor core with complexities ranging in the 30 million transistors per chip. What is behind such an evolution is clearly two challenges that still have not been met: (a) Designing for such complexities, using system level design methodologies going from the behavioral level down to silicon (that means, software-hardware co-design, advanced floor planning and complex validation approaches). (b) Power conscious design (that means designing with data throughput constraints within the chip and minimizing power consumption with low-voltage, high-speed optimization of the device behavior). Capitalizing on intellectual property in a company will also be of major importance to address the new, emerging markets like multimedia, where experiences from various market segments should be reused in a single system on a chip. The reusability of functions previously designed in heterogeneous technologies will be needed (abstraction from netlist). The economy of system on chip remains to be proven in most of the applications where limited quantities are needed and where programmability may be the only solution to go to.","1093-0167","0-8186-7304","10.1109/VTEST.1996.510826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=510826","","Silicon;Microprocessors;Transistors;System-level design;Power system planning;Throughput;Energy consumption;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Intellectual property","ULSI;integrated circuit design;circuit CAD;industrial property","system on silicon;chip complexity;system level design methodologies;behavioral level;software-hardware co-design;floor planning;validation approaches;power conscious design;data throughput constraints;power consumption;intellectual property;market segments;programmability","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the approach. The contribution of the approach is threefold. First, the approach applies the theory of model-based design with OSEK/VDX standard in automotive electronics domain.

Until now, there has not been significant research investigating the interaction between these optimizations. In this work, we investigate this interaction and propose a selective hardware/compiler strategy to optimize cache locality for integer numerical (array-intensive), and mixed codes. In our framework, the role of the compiler is to identify program regions that can be optimized at compile time using loop and data transformations and to mark (at compile-time) the unoptimizable regions with special instructions that activate/deactivate a hardware optimization mechanism selectively at run-time. Our results show that our technique can improve program performance by as much as 60% with respect to the base configuration and 17% with respect to a non-selective hardware/compiler approach.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253704","","Hardware;Optimizing compilers;Program processors;Runtime;Software performance;Design optimization;Detection algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Prefetching","cache storage;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;memory architecture","cache behavior;data locality optimization;data-intensive embedded applications;cache locality;loop transformations;data transformations;optimization mechanism;base configuration","","2","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the polar coordinate system, the feature sets are robust and independent of size and angle variation according to the user characteristics. The use of HMMs instead of a traditional Euclidian distance metric for the determination of the degree of match between a test signature and a reference signature model brings about a significant improvement in performance as it permits the incorporation of heuristics. The experiments shows that the proposed method gives lower equal error rate 2.2% from 50,000 testing cases.","","0-7695-1692","10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030931","","Handwriting recognition;Hidden Markov models;Writing;Pattern recognition;Space technology;Testing;Speech recognition;Databases;Sampling methods;Software","handwriting recognition;hidden Markov models;real-time systems;feature extraction;probability;optimisation","online signature verification system;hidden Markov model;polar space;HMM models;polar coordinate system;feature sets;Euclidian distance metric;reference signature model;heuristics;signature database;feature extraction;probability","","9","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A community model and some resource usage models are assumed to figure out the optimization problem. A cost function is introduced. The function consists of the three kinds of cost/loss for the depreciation time of owned resource. The function value grows when owned resource is too much, and also grows when owned resource is too little.

In the existing performance evaluation methods, two crucial components are usually missing: 1) automatic training of algorithms with free parameters and 2) statistical and error analysis of experimental results. We use the following five-step methodology to quantitatively compare the performance of page segmentation algorithms: 1) first, we create mutually exclusive training and test data sets with groundtruth, 2) we then select a meaningful and computable performance metric, 3) an optimization procedure is then used to search automatically for the optimal parameter values of the segmentation algorithms on the training data set, 4) the segmentation algorithms are then evaluated on the test data set, and, finally, 5) a statistical and error analysis is performed to give the statistical significance of the experimental results. In particular, instead of the ad hoc and manual approach typically used in the literature for training algorithms, we pose the automatic training of algorithms as an optimization problem and use the simplex algorithm to search for the optimal parameter value. A paired-model statistical analysis and an error analysis are then conducted to provide confidence intervals for the experimental results of the algorithms. This methodology is applied to the evaluation of live page segmentation algorithms of which, three are representative research algorithms and the other two are well-known commercial products, on 978 images from the University of Washington III data set.

The information can be obtained during the simulation of the protocol. In the case, the final goal of such a simulation is to achieve 100 percent of coverage for all the possible transitions of the protocol.

Using a limited set of simple test problems, we compare the performance of SA/SAN with the commercial package OptQuest. Results demonstrate that SA/SAN can outperform OptQuest when properly tuned. The practical difficulty lies in specifying an appropriate set of SA/SAN gain coefficients for a given application. Further results demonstrate that a multistart approach greatly improves the coverage and robustness of SA/SAN, while also providing insights useful in directing iterative improvement of the gain coefficients before each new start.

Recent advances in simulation technology make it possible to emulate real world control systems by using a system's control logic to interact with a simulation model. Routing logic, PLC or PC control software, sequencing algorithms, and more can be integrated, tested, and debugged within a simulation environment. Simulation models communicate with control software and provide animation and statistical-output for evaluating control logic and material handling systems. Traditionally, simulation models have been a good tool to test and refine system algorithms and control logic. However, once refined, the algorithms and logic must be re-implemented in the real system. One of the main benefits of emulation is that it eliminates the need to re-implement code. Because the actual control system is used to develop, test, and refine algorithms and logic, it exists as developed in the real system. This eliminates re-implementation errors and provides greater confidence in the emulation results. Emulation has been used for a Rapistan Systems project to test, debug, and optimize complex algorithms and control logic. Emulation of the complex pick and pack conveyor system is presented.

Solving such optimization problems requires a methodology for representing and manipulating the strategies in conjunction with the given problem in the troubleshooting domain. It is emphasized that an expert diagnostic system should be able to choose and implement a diagnostic strategy depending on the current situation. To facilitate such an ability, it is necessary to create a methodology for representing different diagnostic strategies, to provide tools for evaluating the current situation (e.g. specifics of the failure rates, costs, system topology, etc.), and to provide a mechanism for matching and implementing a diagnostic strategy in the given situation.

Assuming the availability of perfect information, we investigate theoretically optimal allocation schemes for some special cases. We compare our theoretically optimal solutions with existing approximation methods using a series of numerical examples. While perfect information is not available in real life, such an optimal solution provides an upper bound for the simulation efficiency we can achieve. The results indicate that the simulation efficiency can still be further improved beyond the existing methods.

"Prioritized token-based mutual exclusion for distributed systems","F. Mueller","Inst. fur Inf., Humboldt-Univ., Berlin, Germany","Proceedings of the First Merged International Parallel Processing Symposium and Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","","1998","","","791","795","A number of solutions have been proposed for the problem of mutual exclusion in distributed systems. Some of these approaches have since been extended to a prioritized environment suitable for real-time applications but impose a higher message passing overhead than our approach. We present a new protocol for prioritized mutual exclusion in a distributed environment. Our approach uses a token-based model working on a logical tree structure, which is dynamically modified. In addition, we utilize a set of local queues whose union would resemble a single global queue. Furthermore, our algorithm is designed for out-of-order message delivery, handles messages asynchronously and supports multiple requests from one node for multi-threaded nodes. The prioritized algorithm has an average overhead of O(log(n)) messages per request for mutual exclusion with a worst-case overhead of O(n), where n represents the number of nodes in the system. Thus, our prioritized algorithm matches the message complexity of the best non-prioritized algorithms while previous prioritized algorithms have a higher message complexity, to our knowledge. Our concept of local queues can be incorporated into arbitrary token-based protocols with or without priority support to reduce the amount of messages. Performance results indicate that the additional functionality of our algorithm comes at the cost of 30% longer response times within our test environment for distributed execution when compared with an unprioritized algorithm. This result suggests that the algorithm should be used when strict priority ordering is required.","1063-7133","0-8186-8404","10.1109/IPPS.1998.670018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=670018","","Protocols;Delay;Testing;Message passing;Tree data structures;Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Memory architecture;Hardware;Broadcasting","message passing;real-time systems;communication complexity;protocols;distributed algorithms;software performance evaluation","prioritized token-based mutual exclusion;distributed systems;real-time applications;message passing overhead;protocol;logical tree structure;local queues;global queue;out-of-order message delivery;multiple requests;multithreaded nodes;overhead;message complexity;performance;response times;strict priority ordering","","25","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tolerance assignment is defined as a statistical optimization problem, where the optimization objective function is a measure of the manufacturing profit.

Using optimized MPI calls can result in reasonable performance gain for most of MPI based applications running on most of high-performance distributed systems. Since relative performance of different MPI function calls and system architectures can be uncorrelated, tuning system-dependent MPI applications by exploring the alternatives of using different MPI calls is the simplest but most effective optimization method. The paper first shows that for a particular system, there are noticeable performance differences between using various MPI calls that result in the same communication pattern. These performance differences are in fact not similar across different systems. The paper then shows that good performance optimization for an MPI application on different systems can be obtained by using different MPI calls for different systems. The communication patterns that were experimented in this paper include the point-to-point and collective communications. The MPI based application used for this study is the general-purpose transient dynamic finite element application and the benchmark problems are the public domain 3D car crash problems. The experiment results show that for the same communication purpose, using alternative MPI calls can result in quite different communication performance on the Fujitsu HPC2500 system and the 8-node AMD Athlon cluster, but very much the same performance on the other systems such as the Intel Itanium2 and the AMD Opteron clusters.","","0-7695-2297","10.1109/SERA.2005.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563154","","Computer aided software engineering;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Application software;Finite element methods;Message passing;Delay;Performance gain;Optimization methods;Vehicle crash testing","message passing;optimisation;remote procedure calls;performance evaluation","system-dependent application tuning;MPI call;high-performance distributed system;optimization method;point-to-point communication;collective communication;general-purpose transient dynamic finite element application;3D car crash problem;Fujitsu HPC2500 system;8-node AMD Athlon cluster;Intel Itanium2;AMD Opteron cluster","","","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the stochastic nature of NNs, it is extremely hard to verify the correctness of a NN application by exhaustive testing. It is also very hard to tell whether a NN application is generating the intended results, because there are many parameters and variables. Lastly, NN software is usually time intensive and highly optimised code is required. This paper explores the use of computer algebra to synthesize neural network applications. The author can generate highly reliable and efficient codes (probably the most efficient possible) from a high level NN algebraic specification. The computer algebra package not only handles most of the algebraic manipulation in the derivation of the computation formulas, but also performs simplification and verification.

Artificial sample defects, representing sources of PD, have been implanted into a GIS system. By performing a statistical analysis of charge, energy and phase angle on the measured signals, it is possible to solve the diagnosis problem by a noise resistant software solution.

Yet, these systems generally must provide all test capabilities required by the supported units-under-test (UUT). The successful development of man-portable systems requires a paradigm shift in the test system architectural design. General purpose ATE architectures by and large still do not address the means to satisfy the UUT's expected operational environment during test. Instrument packaging has evolved from bench-top and rack-mount configurations to card/modular level products. However, most card/modular level instruments still need the support of card cages and backplanes for intercommunication, control, physical constraint, power and cooling and the legacy system architecture remains. It is a significant challenge to produce a rugged, man-portable automated test system by selecting only those hardware and software components available from standard commercial test equipment catalogs. Yet, the RFP requirements in conjunction with cost and schedule constraints mandate the building of a target system from as many existing commercial building blocks as possible. This paper presents a systems approach to the design, development and deployment of man-portable test systems that meet or exceed the user's real UUT test requirements.

Our scheme uses a dynamic task allocation algorithm with an optimistic execution policy where the number of task executions is kept close to the minimum required to produce fault-free results.

Klas","Siemens Corporate Res. & Dev., Munich, Germany","CompEuro 1992 Proceedings Computer Systems and Software Engineering","","1992","","","604","611","An approach for the hierarchical solution of large generalized stochastic Petri net models is presented. The method is based on the aggregation of submodels to substitute networks. The stochastic equivalence between these models is achieved by matching the flow time distributions of tokens in the submodel and in the aggregate net. This leads to a nonlinear optimization problem for finding the best aggregate net. As the main result, some insight is provided into the crucial point of estimating the parameters of a suitable aggregate net from a flow time distribution of the original net.

In this paper, it is shown that much better generalization can be obtained by using a variable interpolation kernel in combination with conjugate gradient optimization of the similarity metric and kernel size. The resulting method is called variable-kernel similarity metric (VSM) learning. It has been tested on a number of standard classification data sets, and on these problems it shows better generalization than backpropagation and most other learning methods. An important advantage is that the system can operate as a black box in which no model minimization parameters need to be experimentally set by the user. The number of parameters that must be determined through optimization are orders of magnitude less than for backpropagation or RBF networks, which may indicate that the method better captures the essential degrees of variation in learning.","","0-7803-1421","10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713963","","Kernel;Learning systems;Interpolation;Neural networks;Testing;Optimization methods;Training data;Computer science;Application software;Radial basis function networks","neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);generalisation (artificial intelligence);interpolation;optimisation","generalization;nearest-neighbour interpolation;learning;variable interpolation kernel;conjugate gradient optimization;variable-kernel similarity metric learning;neural network","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But benchmarking of new software strategies is a very complex problem, because it is difficult (if not impossible) to test, validate and verify the results of the various schemes in completely different settings. This is even more true in the case of database systems because the benchmarking also depends on the types of queries presented to the databases used in the benchmarking experiments. Query optimization strategies in relational database systems rely on approximately estimating the query result sizes to minimize the response time for user-queries. Among the many query result size estimation techniques, the histogram-based techniques are by far the most commonly used ones in modern-day database systems. These techniques estimate the query result sizes by approximating the underlying data distributions, and, thus, are prone to estimation errors. In two recent works , we proposed (and thoroughly analyzed) two new forms of histogram-like techniques called the rectangular and trapezoidal attribute cardinality maps (ACM), respectively, that give much smaller estimation errors than the traditional equi-width and equi-depth histograms currently being used by many commercial database systems. This paper reports how the benchmarking of the Rectangular-ACM (R-ACM) and the Trapezoidal-ACM (T-ACM) for query optimization can be achieved. By conducting an extensive set of experiments using the acclaimed TPC-D benchmark queries and database , we demonstrate that these new ACM schemes are much more accurate than the traditional histograms for query result size estimation. Apart from demonstrating the power of the ACMs, this paper also shows how the TPC-D benchmarking can be achieved using a large synthetic database with many different patterns of synthetic queries, which are representative of a real-world business environment.","1083-4419;1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.810909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245267","","Database systems;Benchmark testing;Query processing;Delay;Relational databases;Estimation error;Histograms;Business;Councils;Software testing","benchmark testing;query processing;relational databases;software engineering","attribute cardinality maps benchmarking;software technique;benchmarking;query optimization;relational database systems;histogram-like techniques;TPC-D benchmark queries","","","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Formalization leads to the identification of the so-called sub-patterns, which are the recurring fundamental elements design patterns are composed of.

The motivation behind its application to this problem is its invariance to certain types of image distortion and noise, as well as its amenability to real-time implementation. This paper derives one constraint which must be satisfied for a correct match. This has been termed the rank constraint. Experimental work has shown that this constraint is capable of resolving ambiguous matches, thereby improving matching reliability. A novel matching algorithm incorporating the rank constraint has also been proposed. This modified algorithm consistently resulted in an increased percentage of correct matches, for all test imagery used. Furthermore, the rank constraint has been used to devise a method of identifying regions of an image where the rank transform, and hence matching outcome, is more susceptible to noise. Experimental results have shown that the errors predicted using this technique are consistent with the actual errors which result when images are corrupted with noise. Such a method could be used to identify matches which are likely to be incorrect and/or provide a measure of confidence in a match.","1083-4419;1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.969491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969491","","Testing;Stereo vision;Constraint theory;Image matching;Face detection;Area measurement;Application software;Biomedical imaging;Computer graphics;Biomedical engineering","image matching;stereo image processing;transforms;reliability","reliability analysis;rank transform;nonparametric technique;stereo matching;real-time implementation;rank constraint;ambiguous match resolution;errors","","28","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Work on compilation has also led to the development of the call graph, the procedure dependence graph (PDG), and the static-single assignment (SSA) graph. Compilers are not the only source-code analysis tools to use internal graphs. A variety of software engineering tools incorporate a variety of different graphs. A study of techniques that improve graph-based program analysis is presented. Several different techniques are considered, including forming strongly-connected components, topological sorting, and removing transitive edges. Graph reachability, a pervasive graph analysis operation, is used as a representative graph analysis operation in the study. Data collected from a test bed of just over 1000000 lines of code is presented. This data illustrates the impact on computation time of the improvement techniques. Overall, the combination of all techniques produces a 71% reduction in run-time (and 64% reduction in memory usage). In other words, they increase the size of the problem that can be effectively handled by factor of over three times.","","0-7695-2005","10.1109/SCAM.2003.1238046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238046","","Large-scale systems;Optimization;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing;Runtime;Educational institutions;Software engineering;Sorting;Tree graphs","program diagnostics;reachability analysis;graph theory;software performance evaluation;data structures","source code analysis;graph reachability algorithms;control flow graph;call graph;procedure dependence graph;SSA graph;static single assignment graph;graph based program analysis;strongly connected components;topological sorting;transitive edge removing;performance optimization","","9","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We therefore introduce an algorithm to restructure dataflow graphs so that they can be synthesized in high-quality arithmetic circuits, especially when arithmetic operations are interspersed with logic operations. On typical software benchmarks, the new technique reduces the critical path by around 20-40% and generally achieves the quality of manual implementations.

A plasma armature is employed to avoid the friction produced by a sliding metal armature and, in particular, to prevent high-Z impurities from entering the tokamak. High currents are used to achieve high accelerations, resulting in high plasma temperatures. Consequently, the plasma armature ablates and accumulates material from the pellet and gun barrel. This increases inertial and viscous drag, lowering acceleration. A railgun model has been developed to compute the acceleration in the presence of these losses. The model suggests that, depending on the rail and insulator materials used, there is a point of diminishing returns. Namely, for a given current, there is an acceleration time beyond which little or no increase in pellet speed is produced. The optimal pulse width was determined by identifying the time at which the acceleration decreased to zero. In order to quantify these losses, the ablation coefficient, /spl alpha/, and drag coefficient, C/sub d/, must be determined. These coefficients are estimated based on the pellet acceleration. The sensitivity of acceleration to /spl alpha/ and C/sub d/ has been calculated using the model. Once /spl alpha/ and C/sub d/ have been determined, their values are applied to the model to compute the appropriate current pulse width. An optimization program was written in LabVIEW software to carry out this procedure. This program was then integrated into the existing code used to operate the railgun system. Preliminary results obtained after test firing the gun indicate that the program computes reasonable values for /spl alpha/ and C/sub d/ and calculates realistic pulse widths.","0018-9464;1941-0069","","10.1109/20.560076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=560076","","Rails;Acceleration;Railguns;Plasma temperature;Space vector pulse width modulation;Plasma accelerators;Plasma materials processing;Hydrogen;Fusion reactors;Friction","particle beam fusion accelerators;fusion reactors;railguns;optimisation","rail current optimization;railgun hydrogen pellet injector;fusion reactor refueling;plasma armature;tokamak;acceleration;ablation coefficient;drag coefficient;inertial drag;viscous drag;LabVIEW software;pulse width;automation;H","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We hypothesize that these techniques, which rely on making binary judgments about a code element's relevance to a feature, are overly sensitive to the quality of the input. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a more robust alternative, whose most distinguishing characteristic is that it employs ranking heuristics to determine a code element's relevance to a feature. We believe that our technique is less sensitive with respect to the quality of the input and we claim that it is more effective when used by developers unfamiliar with the target system. We validate our claim by applying our technique to three systems with comprehensive test suites. A developer unfamiliar with the target system spent a limited amount of effort preparing the test suite for analysis.

We have examined a novel system view that allows for power savings by decreasing the required number of memory accesses to put a frame on the screen. A two-step optimization method for existing platforms is presented. Measurements on a multimedia application show that, on average, power savings of 72% can be obtained on the display related memory accesses.

A small engine which is used to supply power approximately equal to the average load power is coaxially configured with an induction motor with an external rotor which is used to supply the peaking power required by the required peaking load of vehicle. The motor can also absorb the excess power of the engine while the load power is less than the peak power. The excess power will be used to charge the vehicular battery pack to keep state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack as the regenerative braking power. With the electrically assist principle, a controller for hybrid ISG assemble has been developed, and a fuzzy logic control strategy used to control the ISG system and motor was discussed. The control system for hybrid propulsion system is responsible for collecting information relative to vehicle and judges the load rate of engine and motor, and finally decides the operating state and rate of power distribution between engine and motor. By optimizing the system efficiency and minimizing fuel consumption and emission, the optimal performance will be reached. Electronics control unit (ECU) of hybrid propulsion system controls ECUs of engine, motor and automatic mechanics transmission (AMT), and monitors the state of battery management system (BMS), they communicate with each other and exchange information by control area network (CAN) bus interface. In order to accelerate developing process of hybrid propulsion system, a rapid developing system called on-line debugging and programming software has been developed. This system runs in PC, and communicates with the ECU of hybrid propulsion system by serial communication interface (SCI) RS232, but the ECU of hybrid propulsion system communicates with the ECUs of engine, AMT, BMS and accessory by CAN bus. This system mainly includes the following functions: (1) field test and bench test, (2) parameter calibration, (3) on-ling debugging for HEV, AMT and CAN bus, (4) vehicle dynamics simulation, (5) on-line programming, (6) troubleshooting etc. Those functions may achieve the rapid development on hardware and software of control system for hybrid propulsion system. In addition, the on-line debugging and programming system can monitor state information of overall system and modify parametric maps or update control program onboard by the on-line debugging or programming function. Based on the on-line debugging software package developed by our group at HUBEI automotive industries institute, the hybrid ISG assemble and its controller have been designed. Finally, experiments verify that the system is feasible and reliable, it can save 30%-50% developing time for the ISG hybrid propulsion system.","","0-7803-9435","10.1109/ICVES.2005.1563662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563662","","Control systems;Debugging;Propulsion;Engines;Automatic control;Functional programming;Power supplies;Vehicles;Batteries;System testing","hybrid electric vehicles;program debugging;starting;automotive components;DC motors;fuzzy control;control system synthesis;controller area networks;control engineering computing;software packages;software engineering;electric propulsion;power engineering computing","on-line debugging system;integrated starter/generator;hybrid propulsion;state of charge;regenerative braking power;fuzzy logic control strategy;power distribution;electronics control unit;automatic mechanics transmission;battery management system;control area network;CAN bus interface;programming software;serial communication interface;field test;bench test;parameter calibration;HEV;vehicle dynamics simulation;on-line programming;software package","","1","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel approach to cluster processes to share a communication channel. An iterative graph-based clustering algorithm is driven by a heterogeneous cost function which takes into account bit widths, the probability of access collisions on the channels, cost for arbitration logic as well as the availability of interface resources on the hardware components to trade-off cost against performance in a most optimum fashion.

Conference and Exhibition 2001","","2001","","","38","","Today's situation in this field is characterized by three distinct development phases: First, the analysis and design of functionality. This type of work is typically performed in the laboratory, i.e. on the desk. Second, the implementation of a prototype system, realized by (semi)automatic code generation and followed by a test with a ""Lab-car"" or in a real vehicle. The third and final step comprises the calibration and fine-tuning of algorithms and their parameters, commonly done in a real car. However, there are some flaws associated with this approach. There is no support for multiple interconnected electronic control units. Automatic generation of code of production quality is still a challenging task. And there is a large gap between the properties of a virtual car and the behavior of the real vehicle. The latter is one reason why nowadays the adjustment of calibration parameters still needs to be done manually. In the future, the picture outlined above will change remarkably. Function development tools will be able to generate efficient and reliable software code automatically. Vehicle models will mimic the characteristics of the real object to an extent we cannot imagine today. And automated test without manual interference will unprecedented degree of optimization and quality throughout a complex network of electronic control units. Almost the entire development process will be shifted to the desk with no need for costly, risky, and error-prone experiments with prototype engines or vehicles.","1530-1591","0-7695-0993","10.1109/DATE.2001.914998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914998","","Automotive electronics;Vehicles;Prototypes;Calibration;Automatic control;Laboratories;System testing;Production;Software tools;Electronic equipment testing","automotive electronics;design engineering;calibration;modelling","automotive electronic systems;functionality;prototype system;automatic code generation;calibration;production quality;vehicle models;electronic control units;design engineering","","4","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a benchmark, the results are compared to those from an existing analytical algorithm for amorphous slicing, which was written specifically to perform well with the sorts of program under consideration. The results, while tentative at this stage, do give grounds for optimism.

We study the high level metrics such as IPC and procedure level profiles as well as lower level measurements such as execution paths exercised by various input sets on the SPEC2000int benchmark. Our study indicates that the test input sets are not suitable to be used for simulation because they do not have an execution profile similar to the reference input runs. The train data set is better than the test data sets at maintaining similar profiles to the reference input set. However, the observed execution paths leading to cache misses are very different between using the smaller input sets and the reference input sets. For current profile based optimizations, the differences in quality of profiles may not have a significant impact on performance, as tested on the Itanium processor with an Intel compiler. However, we believe the impact of profile quality will be greater for more aggressive profile guided optimizations, such as cache prefetching.","","0-7695-1534","10.1109/INTERA.2002.995842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995842","","Optimizing compilers;Benchmark testing;Computer science;Microprocessors;Feedback;Design optimization;Program processors;Runtime","virtual machines;cache storage;software performance evaluation;program compilers","program behavior predictability;reduced input data sets;SPEC benchmarks;profile feedback compiler optimizations;performance simulation;high level metrics;procedure level profiles;IPC profiles;execution paths;SPEC2000int benchmark;test input sets;train input sets;cache misses;reference input sets;Itanium processor;Intel compiler;cache prefetching;profile guided optimizations","","4","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The compiled code simulation environment in Verilog poses unique challenges and opportunities for incremental compilation.

In the US, NASA is also actively investigating the feasibility of IPv6 based networks for the aviation needs of the United States. In Europe, the Eurocontrol lead, Internet protocol for aviation exchange (iPAX) Working Group is actively investigating the various ways of migrating the aviation authorities backbone infrastructure from X.25 based networks to an IPv6 based network. For the last 15 years, the global aviation community has pursued the development and implementation of an industry-specific set of communications standards known as the aeronautical telecommunications network (ATN). These standards are now beginning to affect the emerging military global air traffic management (GATM) community as well as the commercial air transport community. Efforts are continuing to gain a full understanding of the differences and similarities between ATN and Internet architectures as related to communications, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) infrastructure choices. This research paper describes the implementation of the IPv6 testbed at Computer Networks & Software, Inc. and it's interface connection mechanism to Eurocontrol and NASA's (Cleveland) testbed in the first phase of the project. In the second phase this research work investigates the performance issues of aviation applications such as controller to pilot data link communication (CPDLC), on an IPv6 based backbone network. Aviation applications are grouped into different priority levels. Desired quality of service (QoS) to each priority level is implemented via Diffserv implementation. This research work looks into the possibility of providing similar QoS performance for aviation application in an IPv6 network as is provided in an ATN based network. The testbed consists of three autonomous systems. The autonomous system represents CNS domain, NASA domain and a EUROCONTROL domain. The primary mode of connection between CNS IPv6 testbed and NASA and EUROCONTROL IPv6 testbed is initially a set of IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. The aviation application under test (CPDLC) consists of two processes running on different IPv6 enabled machines. These processes communicate with each other over the IPv6 network. One machine resides on the CNS portion of the testbed and other may reside in NASA (Cleveland) and/or in Eurocontrol. The IPv6 packets between Eurocontrol, NASA and CNS testbeds would be carried on IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. We present some results, which suggest that IPv6 QoS has matured enough, so as to provide the QoS service, which is similar in capability to die ATN architecture. We implemented three basic priorities of flow: (1) command & control; (2) surveillance; and (3) general traffic. Various parameters like throughput, packet loss and delay are investigated. The results are analyzed to get a conceptual view of the effect of IPv6 based network on the aviation applications.","1095-323X","0-7803-8155","10.1109/AERO.2004.1367941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367941","","NASA;Quality of service;Europe;Spine;Military standards;Surveillance;Software testing;Application software;Space technology;IP networks","aircraft communication;data communication;IP networks;Internet;aerospace simulation;protocols;air traffic control;telecommunication links;quality of service;telecommunication standards","aviation application;aviation industries;IPv6 based networks;United States;Europe;Eurocontrol;Internet protocol for aviation exchange;iPAX Working Group;aviation authorities backbone infrastructure;X.25 based networks;communications standards;aeronautical telecommunications network;military global air traffic management;air transport community;Internet architectures;CNS infrastructure;IPv6 testbed;Computer Networks & Software Inc;controller to pilot data link communication;quality of service;Diffserv implementation;autonomous systems;CNS domain;NASA domain;EUROCONTROL domain;IPv6 packets;IPv4 tunnels","","3","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The few research works that have addressed the problem of encoder optimization by frame type decision rely on measures of motion magnitude and amount to select the number of B frames. In contrast to such solutions, in this paper we advocate the idea of motion similarity in terms of speed and direction as the basis for deciding how many B frames to encode between any two stored frames. Such similarity is evaluated by the collinearity of the displacements in successive frames. Experimental results using the proposed decision method integrated in our H.264 compliant codec show that the bit rates achieved in the compressed bitstreams are optimal and near-optimal for the tested sequences, and are lower by up to 26% than those obtained using the default number of B frames of typical encoders. Furthermore, such bit rate savings are obtained with no subjective loss in the visual quality of the decoded sequences. Last but not least, our method provides a simple form of temporal scalability and can be employed in any coding system that makes use of I, P and B frames.","1522-4880","0-7803-8554","10.1109/ICIP.2004.1421678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1421678","","Bit rate;Decoding;Application software;Motion measurement;Codecs;Testing;Scalability;Art;Video sequences;Cameras","video coding;optimisation;data compression;image motion analysis;decoding;code standards;video codecs;image sequences","state-of-art encoder;real life application;B frame;I frame;P frame;encoder optimization;motion magnitude measurement;collinearity displacement;integrated decision method;H.264 compliant codec;bit rate;bitstream compression;sequence testing;visual quality;decoded sequence;temporal scalability","","5","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim is to produce an optimal siting plan that does not violate any system or operational constraint and is optimal in terms of the voltage deviation from the ideal and the cost incurred through the installation and use of reactive power compensation devices. This multiobjective problem is solved through the use of Pareto optimality. The developed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 30-bus system and on a reduced practical system that was developed with the cooperation of the National Grid. The algorithm is validated via the comparison with the SCORPION software package, which is a Linear Programming-based (LP) planning tool developed and used by the National Grid for the England and Wales transmission system. This work demonstrates that the IGA is superior to the LP-based method, both in terms of system conditions and installation and utilization cost when fixed and dynamic compensation devices are being sited; the system performance is optimized via the adjustment of tap settings and controller characteristic across multiple operating states.","0885-8950;1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.841236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388544","Genetic algorithms;intact and contingent operating states;multiobjectives;reactive compensation planning","Genetic algorithms;Reactive power;Cost function;Power system planning;System testing;Software algorithms;Software packages;System performance;Optimization methods;Control systems","genetic algorithms;reactive power;power system interconnection;power transmission planning;Pareto optimisation;linear programming;power engineering computing","genetic algorithm;optimal reactive power compensation planning;national grid system;optimization;Pareto optimality;IEEE 30-bus system;SCORPION software package;linear programming tool;LP-based method","","46","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Polynomial data dependence analysis techniques, such as the Banerjee test and the I-Test, can efficiently compute data dependence information for simple instances of the data dependence problem. In more complicated cases such as triangular or trapezoidal loop regions with direction vector constraints these tests, including the triangular Banerjee test, ignore or simplify many of the constraints and thus introduce further approximations. The I-Test and the Omega test are two data dependence tests that can provide exact data dependence information. In addition the Omega test can accurately handle complex loop regions but at a higher computation cost. We extend the ideas behind the I-Test to handle such complex regions which are frequently found in actual source code. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm, the VI-Test that can detect data dependences in loops with triangular bounds and symbolic variables subject to any direction vector. We also perform an extensive experimental evaluation of the various dependence tests, including the I-Test, the VI-Test and the Omega test.

The starvation analyzer is based on a set-theoretic model of starvation. It uses a proof tree produced by the deadlock analyzer to define the possible computation space of the design. A preprocessing phase of the starvation tool optimizes the analysis so that the resulting analysis is efficient. Unlike livelock analysis in state machines, the starvation analyzer does not require a priori specification of home states to discern liveness. The critical race analysis tool provides semiautomatic proof of critical races by identifying nondeterministic rendezvous (races) from the proof tree generated by the deadlock analyzer, and then assisting the human operator in identifying which of these constitute critical races. Several design examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the two analysis methods.<<ETX>>","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.57622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=57622","","System recovery;Algorithm design and analysis;Information analysis;Specification languages;Automatic testing;Delay;Software testing;Humans;System analysis and design","Ada;program interpreters;programming;software tools;specification languages;system recovery","race analyzers;critical race analysis tools;Ada designs;temporal analysis toolset;operational specification language;language interpreter;deadlock analyzer;starvation analyzer;set-theoretic model;deadlock analyzer;computation space;preprocessing phase;starvation tool;liveness;semiautomatic proof;nondeterministic rendezvous;human operator;design examples","","17","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To deal with this problem, we present a library independent algorithm for the partitioning and analysis of static digital CMOS circuits described at the switch level. The algorithm recognizes inverters, NANDs, and NORs. It also checks whether a partition can set its output to a high impedance state, thus being capable of partitioning large bus structures with tristate gates. Our approach supports existing ATPG algorithms at the gate level. Moreover, it allows a mixed-level approach for ATPG using detailed fault models at the switch level for whatever partitions it is necessary. Our implementation processes in the order of 2000 transistors per second. This is for circuits containing combinational and sequential logic on a state-of-the-art workstation.

It predicts the error coverage for one input sequence based on fault injection results obtained for another input sequence. Although the accuracy of the prediction is low, path based error coverage prediction manages to correctly rank the input sequences with, respect to error detection coverage, provided that the difference in the actually coverage is significant.

The limitations of creepage distance, CD, as design base has become recognized. Exaggerated with excesses in material and production, or insufficient with risk of failure in service, the end result is unavoidably increased total cost. The obvious restriction is that CD considers distance. The conductivity of a surface is, apart from the specific surface conductivity, dependent only on surface shape. Referred to as form factor when measuring test results and K-value, Kv, when used for design, this parameter describes the shape exactly and is the true design base. The problem is that Kv is mathematically complicated. Software development has enhanced CAE programs and solved this problem. But these programs are custom made and not readily accessible. Herein we present a method to determine insulators Kv in a manual but convenient way with acceptable results, valid for all insulator materials and processes. Examples are presented and evaluated for CD and Kv comparison.

Traditional parallelizing compilers do not work effectively on most integer programs, and software profiling slows down program execution too much for real-time analysis. Tracer for Extracting Speculative Threads (TEST) is hardware support that analyzes sequential program execution to estimate performance of possible thread decompositions. This hardware is used in a dynamic parallelization system that automatically transforms unmodified, sequential Java programs to run on TLS processors. In this system, the best thread decompositions found by TEST are dynamically recompiled to run speculatively. The paper describes the analysis performed by TEST and presents simulation results demonstrating its effectiveness on real programs.

The BBN model predicts human and machine reliabilities, given input variables representing the scenario and ranges of environmental conditions (i.e. weather, climate, etc.). A software tool, the System Reliability Analyser (SRA) is described that runs a set of scenarios against the BBN models while systematically varying the ranges of 12 input variables specifying properties of human operators such as training, technical equipment specification and environmental conditions. The tool reports human and technical equipment specifications that ""survive"" the scenario testing at a reliability level higher than a user-defined level. A case study evaluation of the tool is reported using a naval command and control domain, in which different combinations of human roles and equipment requirements specifications are automatically validated against a set of scenarios describing missile attacks on a navy frigate.

The classic buffer insertion algorithm of L.P.P.P. van Ginneken (see ISCAS, p.865-8, 1990) has time complexity O(n/sup 2/), where n is the number of buffer positions. J. Lillis et al. (see IEEE Trans. Solid-Slate Circuits, vol.31, no.3, p.437-47, 1996) extended van Ginneken's algorithm to allow b buffer types in time O(b/sup 2/n/sup 2/). For modern design libraries that contain hundreds of buffers, it is a serious challenge to balance the speed and performance of the buffer insertion algorithm.

The reduction is achieved by the observation that the (Q, C) pairs of the candidates that generate the new candidates must form a convex hull.

A box frame wheelchair and a cantilever frame wheelchair were tested on an ANSI/RESNA curb-drop tester. The accelerations of an ANSI/RESNA test dummy were recorded with an array of 12 accelerometers mounted as four three-axis groups. Signal averaging was used to produce a composite dynamic load history. The dynamic loads were calculated from the acceleration data and the inertia of the test dummy using software written by the authors. These loads were imported into a finite element program (ALGOR) as load cases. A prototype carbon fiber design was then optimized through design and analysis iterations. The results of the acceleration data indicate that the curb-drop test produces an asymmetric loading scheme. One of the rear wheels hits the ground before the other, placing most of the dynamic load on one side of the wheelchair. The favored side appears to be fixed at the time of setup, preliminary results are given for the design of a modular carbon fiber wheelchair using the finite element (FE) method. These results indicate, however, that the use of a static factor of safety is, in most cases, inadequate for the dynamic loads present in the curb-drop test.","1063-6528;1558-0024","","10.1109/86.536771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=536771","","Wheelchairs;Life estimation;Finite element methods;Optical fiber testing;Accelerometers;History;Software testing;Software prototyping;Prototypes;Design optimization","finite element analysis;acceleration;biomedical measurement;biomechanics;handicapped aids;mechanical variables measurement","wheelchair dynamic load data determination;box frame wheelchair;cantilever frame wheelchair;ANSI/RESNA curb-drop tester;ANSI/RESNA test dummy;accelerometers array;inertia;prototype carbon fiber design;ALGOR finite element program;static safety factor;curb-drop test;asymmetric loading scheme;rear wheels","","6","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The transparent implementation is based on the introduction of network agents with proxy, tunneling and signaling functions that have been changing and improving in order to optimize MH-to-MH links by means of suitable notification procedures. In order to avoid intruders and unauthorized users, or those who should acquire privileges or perform dangerous procedures, security features based on an authentication strategy and a secure hash algorithm have been implemented.

"HGA: A Hardware-Based Genetic Algorithm","S. D. Scott; A. Samal; S. Seth","Washington University, St. Louis, MO; NA; NA","Third International ACM Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays","","1995","","","53","59","A genetic algorithm (GA) is a robust problem-solving method based on natural selection. Hardware's speed advantage and its ability to parallelize offer great rewards to genetic algorithms. Speedups of 1-3 orders of magnitude have been observed when frequently used software routines were implemented in hardware by way of reprogrammable field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Reprogrammability is essential in a general-purpose GA engine because certain GA modules require changeability (e.g. the function to be optimized by the GA). Thus a hardware-based GA is both feasible and desirable. A fully functional hardware-based genetic algorithm (the HGA) is presented here as a proof-of-concept system. It was designed using VHDL to allow for easy scalability. It is designed to act as a coprocessor with the CPU of a PC. The user programs the FPGAs which implement the function to be optimized. Other GA parameters may also be specified by the user. Simulation results and performance analyses of the HGA are presented. A prototype HGA is described and compared to a similar GA implemented in software. In the simple tests, the prototype took about 6% as many clock cycles to run as the software-based GA. Further suggested improvements could realistically make the HGA 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the software-based GA.","","0-7695-2550","10.1109/FPGA.1995.241945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377261","Parallel Genetic Algorithms;Function Optimization;Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs);Performance Acceleration;Performance Evaluation","Genetic algorithms;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Software prototyping;Robustness;Problem-solving;Engines;Scalability;Coprocessors;Design optimization","","Parallel Genetic Algorithms;Function Optimization;Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs);Performance Acceleration;Performance Evaluation","","27","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is often not possible to perform static analysis and optimization of a program's memory access behavior unless the program is specifically written for this purpose. We introduce the FORAY model of a program that permits aggressive analysis of the application's memory behavior that further enables such optimization since it consists of 'for' loops and array accesses which are easily analyzable. We present FORAY-GEN, an automated profile-based approach for extraction of the FORAY model from the original program.

In this work we propose new data dependence analysis techniques to handle such complex instances of the dependence problem and increase program parallelization. Our method is based on a set of polynomial time techniques that can prove or disprove dependences in the presence of non-linear expressions, complex loop bounds, arrays with coupled subscripts, and if statement constraints. In addition our algorithm can produce accurate and complete direction vector information enabling the compiler to apply further transformations. To validate our method we performed an experimental evaluation and comparison against the I-Test, the Omega test and the Range test in the Perfect and SPEC benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that our dependence analysis tool is efficient and more effective in program parallelization than the other dependence tests. The improved parallelization of key loops results into higher speedups and better program execution performance in several benchmarks.","1089-795X","0-7695-2429","10.1109/PACT.2005.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1515588","","Data analysis;Optimizing compilers;Benchmark testing;Polynomials;Computer science;High performance computing;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Algorithm design and analysis;Couplings","program control structures;program compilers;software performance evaluation;program testing","data dependence analysis;control structures;compilers;code analysis;program parallelization;polynomial time techniques;I-Test;Omega test;Range test;Perfect benchmark;SPEC benchmark;program execution performance","","4","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The controller, termed optimizing adaptive quality controller (OAQC), can act both as an optimizer-in case equipment models are not available-or as a controller for given models. The main components of the OAQC are shown and a study of its performance is presented. The controller allows one to specify input and output constraints and weights, and input resolutions. A multivariate control chart can be applied either as a deadband on the controller or simply to provide out of control alarms. Experimental designs can be utilized for on-line (recursive) model identification in the optimization phase.

"Formal methods and iterative design","A. F. Monk","Dept. of Psychol., York Univ., UK","IEE Colloquium on Formal Methods and Human-Computer Interaction: II","","1988","","","1/1","1/4","Formal methods allow a system designer to describe precisely how the system will be. In the area of human-computer interaction this means describing the structure and detail of the user interface. Giving the designer tools to think clearly about the decisions made must be helpful. However, the problem of deciding how the user interface is to be designed remains. In particular, to use such tools effectively a designer must have a good understanding of how the users think about the task, what their expectations and priorities are. This kind of information is best obtained by user testing with prototypes. An initial design is put forward and then refined using feedback from typical users doing typical tasks with a prototype. This refinement should happen in parallel with the refinement of a formal model of the user interface by the application of domain independent principles. In the early stages the cost of this procedure can be minimised by using simulations and mock ups rather than full prototypes. This is known as iterative design. This paper describes, through an example, some techniques which can be used to get insights about how a user approaches a task and the difficulties they have with a particular prototype.<<ETX>>","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=209309","","Software engineering;User interfaces","software engineering;user interfaces","formal methods;user expectations;user priorities;iterative design;human-computer interaction;user interface;user testing;prototypes;feedback;refinement;formal model;domain independent principles;simulations;mock ups","","","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In modern computer systems the performance is dominated by the memory performance. Currently, there is neither a systematic design methodology nor a tool for the design of memory systems for general purpose computers. We present a first approach to CAD support for this crucial subtask of system level design. Dependencies between influencing factors and design decisions are explicitly represented by constraints, and constraint logic programming is used to make the design decisions. The memory design is optimized with respect to several objectives by iterating the (re)design cycle. Event driven simulation is used for evaluation of the intermediate results.

"Extending value reuse to basic blocks with compiler support","J. Huang; D. J. Lilja","Sun Microsyst., Palo Alto, CA, USA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Computers","","2000","49","4","331","347","Speculative execution and instruction reuse are two important strategies that have been investigated for improving processor performance. Value prediction at the instruction level has been introduced to allow even more aggressive speculation and reuse than previous techniques. This study suggests that using compiler support to extend value reuse to a coarser granularity than a single instruction, such as a basic block, may have substantial performance benefits. We investigate the input and output values of basic blocks and find that these values can be quite regular and predictable. For the SPEC benchmark programs evaluated, 90 percent of the basic blocks have fewer than four register inputs, five live register outputs, four memory inputs, and two memory outputs. About 16 to 41 percent of all the basic blocks are simply repeating earlier calculations when the programs are compiled with the -O2 optimization level in the GCC compiler. Compiler optimizations, such as loop-unrolling and function inlining, affect the sizes of basic blocks, but have no significant or consistent impact on their value locality, nor the resulting performance. Based on these results, we evaluate the potential benefit of basic block reuse using a novel mechanism called the block history buffer. This mechanism records input and live output values of basic blocks to provide value reuse at the basic block level. Simulation results show that using a reasonably sized block history buffer to provide basic block reuse in a 4-way issue superscalar processor can improve execution time for the tested SPEC programs by 1 to 14 percent, with an overall average of 9 percent when using reasonable hardware assumptions.","0018-9340;1557-9956;2326-3814","","10.1109/12.844346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844346","","Registers;Optimizing compilers;History;Program processors;Testing;Hardware","optimising compilers;software performance evaluation;program testing","compiler support;speculative execution;instruction reuse;processor performance;value prediction;instruction level;SPEC benchmark programs;compiler optimizations;function inlining;block history buffer;simulation results","","16","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many software radio based systems have been designed through the development efforts of both commercial and noncommercial organizations. While the term software radio has meant many things, the ultimate goal in software radio has been the realization of an agile radio that can transmit and receive signals at any carrier frequency using any protocol, all of which can be reprogrammed virtually instantaneously. Such a system places great demands on the limits of data converter and processor technologies since it requires real-time disposition of gigasamples of data produced by direct conversion of wireless signals into digital data. From a processing standpoint, the challenge in software radio is to exploit the three basic processor types-fixed architecture processors, FPGAs, and programmable DSPs/RISCs/CISCs-in such a way as to optimize the three-way trade-offs between speed, power dissipation, and programmability. With respect to the latter characteristic, the issues of high-level language interfaces, portability, and reprogramming speed must be considered. This article describes the architecture and operation of a PC-based software radio receiver. The development environment is a real-time PC-based platform that allows testing to be done in a simple manner using the main software functionality of a PC. The front-end of the receiver implemented in hardware represents a novel wideband design (bandwidth of up to 100 MHz centered at a carrier frequency of up to 2 GHz) that functionally converts wireless signals directly into a gigasample digital data stream in the receiver (and vice versa in the transmitter). This direct conversion approach shows the greatest promise in realizing the main goal of software radio.","0163-6804;1558-1896","","10.1109/35.952928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952928","","Software radio;Receivers;Computer architecture;RF signals;Frequency;Protocols;Real time systems;Signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Digital signal processing","microcomputer applications;radio receivers;software architecture;field programmable gate arrays;digital signal processing chips;reduced instruction set computing;satellite computers","PC-based software receiver architecture;front-end technology;agile radio;software radio based systems;carrier frequency;protocol;data converter;processor technology;wireless signals;direct conversion;digital data;fixed architecture processors;FPGA;programmable DSP;RISC;CISC;speed;power dissipation;wideband design;high-level language interfaces;portability;reprogramming speed;gigasample digital data stream;transmitter;100 MHz;2 GHz","","25","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Extending the methods for steady BCI-CTM developed in preceding projects DELPHI and SEED to the transient domain, a detailed numerical model of the component is needed, which is validated against four dual cold plate (DCP) experiments extracting heat along the main heat flow paths from a package. The validated detailed model is then used for numerical experiments in many environments represented by external BC. Results are used to optimize resistors and capacitors of a small network forming the DCTM. This work is focused on the first part of developing validated detailed dynamic models by comparison of modeling and measurements. Results of the European project PROFIT on thermal transient measurement and modeling of integrated circuit packages are presented. All together sixteen different packages from the three Semiconductor Manufacturers Infineon, Philips, and ST Microelectronics were measured in four DCP environments as defined in the preceding DELPHI and SEED projects. Solutions to measure TO-type and fine pitch packages in the DCP, especially for the critical DCP-4 boundary condition were demonstrated, as well as reduction of interface resistance and increased reproducibility by using Wood's alloy as an interface material. The measurements were simulated using the commercial software packages ANSYS, FLOTHERM, or MARC. The agreement between simulated and measured thermal impedance is 15% or better from steady state (t=1000 s) to transients with t>0.1, i.e., four orders of magnitude. In a few cases, this level of accuracy was kept even over seven orders of magnitude. Increasing relative inaccuracy with shorter transients corresponds to small absolute errors in temperature. So practical pulse temperature prediction will usually be correct within a few degrees. Extraction of geometrical and material parameters will need further improvement.","1521-3331;1557-9972","","10.1109/TCAPT.2004.831791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331549","","Semiconductor device packaging;Integrated circuit measurements;Electrical resistance measurement;Integrated circuit packaging;Boundary conditions;Integrated circuit modeling;Temperature;Numerical models;Cold plates;Resistors","semiconductor device packaging;transient analysis;integrated circuit packaging;software packages;project management;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging);semiconductor device models","thermal transient modeling;experimental validation;European Project PROFIT;boundary condition independent;dynamic compact thermal models;semiconductor products;DELPHI;SEED;transient domain;numerical model;dual cold plate;heat flow paths;numerical experiments;resistors optimization;capacitors optimization;thermal transient measurement;integrated circuit packages;semiconductor manufacturers;Infineon;Philips;ST Microelectronics;DCP environments;TO-type packages;fine pitch packages;DCP-4 boundary condition;interface resistance;Wood alloy;interface material;software packages;ANSYS;FLOTHERM;MARC;thermal impedance;absolute errors;pulse temperature prediction;geometrical parameters;material parameters;thermal characterization;1000 s","","20","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Its major driving force has been the use of device scaling, which has been especially effective in enhancing the performance of digital chips. However, increasingly, diverse system applications have created an additional driving force - the development of more and more system chips with an increased need to integrate more diverse functionality (digital, analog, memory, RF, etc.) within a limited form factor. In addition to current SoCs on a 2D die, a trend for the coming decade is multidimensional die integration on interconnected substrates in a compact package. Correspondingly, a metric analyzing technology trends is presented. At the same time, beyond the innovative foundry/fabless business structure of the 1990s, new business models are evolving for the realization of system chips. Such models, leading to an effective solution called virtual vertical integration, is discussed. System-chip development must also be vertically integrated to achieve optimized performance, but advanced technologies required to realize such integration cover various horizontal segments of knowledge, such as multidimensional-die architecture design, circuit design, and related design automation, as well as novel testing and packaging techniques, leading-edge device and wafer-fabrication technologies, and solution-oriented software coding. In this regard, critical challenges are highlighted in terms of power partitioning, integrated design, and built-in quality assurance for known-good-die, signal integrity in field applications, and technology optimization across different segments. The parallelism of technology solutions with business models, and their conjoined optimization in the coming system-chip era, is illustrated in this paper.","0193-6530","0-7803-8267","10.1109/ISSCC.2004.1332580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332580","","Integrated circuit technology;Multidimensional systems;Packaging;Design optimization;Circuit testing;Radio frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Foundries;Computer architecture;Circuit synthesis","integrated circuit design;system-on-chip;integrated memory circuits;radiofrequency integrated circuits;circuit CAD;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit technology;quality control;integrated circuit reliability;circuit optimisation;reviews","system chips;gigascale integration;GSI;IC industry;device scaling;digital chips;system applications;integrated functionality;digital functionality;analog functionality;memory functionality;RF functionality;form factor;SoC;multidimensional die integration;interconnected substrates;compact package;technology trend metric;foundry-fabless business structure;business models;virtual vertical integration;optimized performance;system-chip development;multidimensional-die architecture design;circuit design;design automation;testing;packaging techniques;wafer-fabrication technologies;device fabrication technologies;solution-oriented software coding;power partitioning;integrated design;built-in quality assurance;known-good-die;signal integrity;technology optimization;technology segments","","4","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the paper, the authors investigate the construction of UIOs by using MOTs. They define a fitness function to guide the search for potential UIOs and use sharing techniques to encourage MOTs to locate UIOs that are calculated as local optima in a search domain.

The program substantially reduces the number of load flow simulation for contingency analysis and voltage stability studies and is based on the impact of the contingency on the load, and the available Mega Watt Margin (MWM). The program provides initially a ranking scheme for first and second level contingencies by comparing their loadability with the maximum loadability of the system. It then makes a short list of important contingencies for detailed analysis. Contingencies that result in a larger reduction of maximum loadability are placed in unacceptable contingency category, whereas, the contingencies pertaining to smaller reduction are put in acceptable contingency category. The contingencies falling in between acceptable and unacceptable categories are termed as significant contingencies and are placed in third category. The proposed method is tested first by the IEEE 118-bus test system, and then is applied to study a large-scale real power system with 25,000 buses.

For best or worst-case execution time assessment of real-time systems it can be used to generate test cases which minimise or maximise execution times or possibly violate the timing specification of the system. As a typical search or optimisation technique, evolutionary testing cannot guarantee to find test cases according to the test objective. The only outcome of such a search process is the time found, but there is no information on how close the result comes to the actual minimal or maximal time. Experiments with this testing technique established a relationship between the complexity of a test object and the success of the search process to find optimal or near optimal solutions. The paper can be seen as an initial attempt to define a predictive complexity measure which is able to indicate the degree of how successfully an evolutionary search might have performed on a test object. The measure is simple and easy to retrieve as it is based on a program's source code. It is extensible, which is important for a further improvement in accuracy. The application of the new measure has shown to be successful for many example test programs but also revealed weaknesses on test objects whose complexity is difficult to capture.","1462-5970","","10.1049/ip-sen:20000525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871132","","","real-time systems","structural performance measure;evolutionary testing;worst-case timing;real-time systems;execution time;test case generation;evolutionary search;optimisation;experiments;predictive complexity measure;source code","","3","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Modern embedded processor architectures show deep instruction pipelines and highly parallel VLIW-like instruction sets. For such architectures, any change in the control flow of a machine program due to a conditional jump may cause a significant code performance penalty. Therefore, the instruction sets of recent VLIW machines offer support for branch-free execution of conditional statements in the form of so-called conditional instructions. Whether an if-then-else statement is implemented by a conditional jump scheme or by conditional instructions has a strong impact on its worst-case execution time. However the optimal selection is difficult particularly for nested conditionals. We present a dynamic programming technique for selecting the fastest implementation for nested if-then-else statements based on estimations.

While its main assets are modularity and the very fact it is becoming a de facto standard, the evolution of the SystemC framework (from version 0.9 to version 2.0.1) suggests the environment is particularly geared toward increasing the framework functionalities rather than improving simulation speed. For cycle-level simulation, speed is a critical factor as simulation can be extremely slow, affecting the extent of design space exploration. In this article, we present a fast SystemC engine that, in our experience, can speed up simulations by a factor of 1.93 to 3.56 over SystemC 2.0.1. This SystemC engine is designed for cycle-level simulators and for the moment, it only supports the subset of the SystemC syntax (signals, methods) that is most often used for such simulators. We achieved greater speed (1) by completely rewriting the SystemC engine and improving the implementation software engineering, and (2) by proposing a new scheduling technique, intermediate between SystemC dynamic scheduling technique and existing static scheduling schemes.

For example, in this paper, Monte Carlo technique has been applied for the analysis of tolerance. The lowest error probabilities are computed according to Bayesian strategy. Using the PSpice software package, a detailed simulation program was developed to implement the proposed technique. The simulation software was packaged and then integrated with a symbolic analysis program that divides the ambiguity sets and structure the software package for the analysis before testing in the fault dictionary.

Hall","AT&T Labs.-Res., USA","Proceedings 17th IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,","","2002","","","107","116","A primary goal of program performance understanding tools is to focus the user's attention directly on optimization opportunities where significant cost savings may be found. Optimization opportunities fall into (at least) three broad categories: the call context of a general component may obviate the need for some of its generality; cross-cutting program aspects may be implemented suboptimally for the particular context of use; and thread dependencies may cause unintended delays. This paper enhances prior work in call path profiling in several ways. First, it provides two different call path oriented views on program performance, a server view and a thread view. The former helps one optimize for throughput, while the latter is useful for optimizing thread latency. The views incorporate a typed time notation for representing different program activities, such as monitor wait and thread preemption times. Second, the new framework allows aspect-oriented program profiling, even when the original program was not designed in an aspect oriented fashion. Finally, the approach is implemented in a tool, CPPROFJ, an aspect-capable call path profiler for Java. It exploits recent developments in the Java APIs to achieve accurate and portable sampling-based profiling. Three case studies illustrate its use.","1938-4300","0-7695-1736","10.1109/ASE.2002.1114999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1114999","","Java;Yarn;Cost function;Delay;Design optimization;Throughput;Monitoring;Testing;Computer bugs;Program processors","application program interfaces;Java;software performance evaluation;multi-threading;reverse engineering;object-oriented programming","CpprofJ;aspect-capable call path profiling;multi-threaded Java;program performance understanding tools;call context;thread dependencies;program performance;typed time notation;Java;monitor wait;thread preemption times;aspect-oriented program profiling","","1","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The notion of mapping aims at finding an equivalent real environment in which all relevant aspects of the performance of different CAC algorithms can be tested without the validation process getting bogged down in side effects (e.g., unrealistically long measuring time to capture rare events etc.). After discussing the testing principles, different performance measures were introduced, based on how the CAC algorithms can be ranked. By analyzing the results a ""toplist"" of CAC algorithms was produced which can help when considering real implementation.

S-Check is a highly-automated sensitivity analysis tool for programs that extends benchmarking and conventional profiling. It predicts how refinements in parts of a program are going to affect performance by making focal changes in code efficiencies and correlating these against overall program performance. This analysis is a sophisticated comparison that catches interactions arising from shared resources or communication links. S-Check's performance assessment ranks code segments ""bottleneck"" according to their sensitivity to the code efficiency changes. This rank-ordered list serves as a guide for tuning applications. In practice, S-Check code analysis yields faster parallel programs. A case study compares and contrasts sensitivity analyses of the same program on different architectures and offers solutions for performance improvement.

The major objective of this research is to optimize the war resource allocations of sorties, for a given war scenario, using genetic algorithms. The war is simulated using THUNDER software. THUNDER software is a stochastic, two-sided, analytical simulation of campaign-level military operations. The simulation is subject to internal unknown noises similar to real war cases. Due to these noises and discreteness in the simulation, as well as in real wars, an adaptive GA approach has been applied to solve this multiobjective optimization problem. Transforming this multiobjective optimization problem to a form suitable for direct implementation of GA was a major accomplishment of this research. A suitable fitness function was chosen after careful research and testing on the GA. Furthermore, the GA parameters were adaptively set to yield smoother and faster fitness convergence. Two fuzzy logic mechanisms were used to adapt the GA parameters. In the first mechanism, the mutation and crossover rates were changed adaptively. In the second mechanism, the fitness function coefficients are changed dynamically in each run.

Therefore AddressLib, a structured scheme for pixel addressing was developed, that can be accelerated by AddressEngine, a coprocessor for visual information processing. In this paper, the architectural design of AddressEngine is described, which in the first step supports a subset of the AddressLib.

In order to effectively solve such combinatorial optimization problems, the paper presents a Lagrangian relaxation neural network (LRNN) for separable optimization problems by combining recurrent neural network optimization ideas with Lagrangian relaxation (LR) for constraint handling. The convergence of the network is proved, and a general framework for neural implementation is established, allowing creative variations. When applying the network to job shop scheduling, the separability of problem formulation is fully exploited, and a new neuron-based dynamic programming is developed making innovative use of the subproblem structure. Testing results obtained by software simulation demonstrate that the method is able to provide near-optimal solutions for practical job shop scheduling problems, and the results are superior to what have been reported in the neural network scheduling literature. In fact, the digital implementation of LRNN for job shop scheduling is similar to the traditional LR approaches. The method, however, has the potential to be implemented in hardware with much improved quality and speed.","1042-296X;2374-958X","","10.1109/70.833193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833193","","Lagrangian functions;Neural networks;Job shop scheduling;Constraint optimization;Recurrent neural networks;Manufacturing;Convergence;Dynamic programming;Software testing;Hardware","constraint handling;convergence;dynamic programming;optimisation;recurrent neural nets;production control;convex programming;combinatorial mathematics","Lagrangian relaxation neural networks;job shop scheduling;combinatorial optimization problems;separable optimization problems;recurrent neural network optimization;constraint handling;neuron-based dynamic programming","","25","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In those warehouses, empty packages are filled with different kinds of gases. To accelerate the filling process, pallets of similar packages are prepared in so-called sorting areas, while assorted pallets of filled ones are composed to fulfil the clients' needs. The main challenge for the authors' industrial partner is to be able to answer its customers' demands in less than 24 hours, while reducing the production costs. These costs have several sources: the numbers of packages within the system, creating stocks but also occupying significant space, the layout of the different areas and their interactions (internal transport, buffers, etc). Simulation has proven to be an efficient tool to help the designer to study the problems related to interactions between process and space. The philosophy of the prototype, called ""depot layout editor"", is to focus on the description of the architecture of the ware-house, while the simulation itself is left to a commercial package, AUTOMOD/spl trade/. Once the warehouse (or part of it) has been described, the software generates the simulation code, which can then be run within the AUTOMOD/spl trade/ environment. One of the advantages of using an external simulation kernel is that it provides extensive statistical analysis tools to evaluate the performance of a given design. The main feature of the approach is to be able to quickly test several architectures and organizations in order to find the one that best suits each warehouse constraints: geometry of the building, availability of stocks, customers' daily orders, etc. This paper will present the several aspects of the simulation preparation (products, process and layout definition), as well as the results obtained on several ware-house simulations studied for validation.","","0-7803-7770","10.1109/ISATP.2003.1217226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217226","","Packaging;Software prototyping;Virtual prototyping;Software packages;Costs;Gases;Acceleration;Filling;Sorting;Production","prototypes;statistical analysis;computer interfaces;optimisation;software packages;warehouse automation;computational geometry","customized simulation interface;simulation tool;software package;gas warehouses;software prototype;production costs;depot layout editor;commercial package;AUTOMOD;statistical analysis tools;warehouse constraints;building geometry;prototype philosophy;embedded packages","","1","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a system specification consisting of multiple periodic task graphs as well as a database of core and integrated circuit characteristics, MOCSYN synthesizes real-time heterogeneous single-chip hardware software architectures using an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm that is designed to escape local minima. The use of multiobjective optimization allows a single system synthesis run to produce multiple designs which trade off different architectural features. Integrated circuit price, power consumption, and area are optimized under hard real-time constraints. MOCSYN differs from previous work by considering problems unique to single-chip systems. It solves the problem of providing clock signals to cores composing a system-on-a-chip. It produces a bus structure which balances ease of layout with the reduction of bus contention.

As a result, data transformations, i.e., transformations that modify memory layout of array data instead of loop structure have been proposed. One of the problems associated with data transformations is the difficulty of selecting a memory layout for an array that is acceptable to the entire program (not just to a single loop). In this paper, we formulate the problem of determining the memory layouts of arrays as a constraint network, and explore several methods of solution in a systematic way.

Commercially available network simulation software, OPNET version 7.0, simulations are presented involving an important application of the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN), Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) over the Very High Frequency Data Link Mode 2 (VDL-2). Communication is modeled for essentially all incoming and outgoing nonstop air-traffic for just three United States cities: Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Detroit. Collision-less PCSMA is successfully tested and compared with the traditional CSMA typically associated with VDL-2. The performance measures include latency, throughput, and packet loss. As expected, PCSMA is much quicker and more efficient than traditional CSMA. These simulation results show the potency of PCSMA for implementing low latency, high throughput and efficient connectivity. We are also testing a new and better data link that could replace CSMA with relative ease.","","0-7803-7367","10.1109/DASC.2002.1067949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1067949","","Testing;Multiaccess communication;Delay;Throughput;Application software;Communication system control;Telecommunication control;Frequency;Cities and towns;Performance loss","carrier sense multiple access;aircraft communication;air traffic control;digital simulation;data communication;digital radio;telecommunication computing","prioritized CSMA;collision-less PCSMA;network simulation software;OPNET version 7.0;Aeronautical Telecommunications Network;ATN;controller-pilot data link communications;CPDLC;latency;throughput;packet loss;performance measures;retransmission analysis;very high frequency data link;VHF data link Mode 2;VDL-2;communication modelling;ATC ground stations;air traffic control","","","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a chosen hardware configuration to deliver optimized performance, various design aspects, resulting in many possible configurations, need to be thoroughly evaluated. Among these are such issues as synchronization between pipelines, cache organization and access policy, dynamic vs static branch prediction, detecting and handling dependency among instructions in different pipeline states. Addressing the above necessitates the use of simulators that provide the design environment in which to model and evaluate candidate configurations and then fine-tune the chosen implementation. The authors describe ePASS, an experimental software based simulator for the IBM RS/6000 and its POWER architecture. They discuss the three basic modules ePASS consists of, each representing a different view of the system: an Instruction Interpreter and Register Set Simulator, a Functional Simulator and a Memory Simulator. Finally they present a simple test case program to run on the simulator, involving branch prediction and execution as well as making use of the interlock mechanism to guarantee synchronization of the branch unit with the fixed point pipeline.","","0-8186-7536","10.1109/ICCSSE.1996.554848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=554848","","Pipelines;Synchronization;Computational modeling;Reduced instruction set computing;Computer aided instruction;High performance computing;Clocks;Hardware;Design optimization;Power system modeling","virtual machines","software-based POWER simulator;ePASS;RISC computer chips;pipelined implementations;independent integer units;independent floating point units;branch prediction mechanisms;multiple instruction dispatch;hardware configuration;optimized performance;design aspects;synchronization;cache organization;access policy;instruction dependency;IBM RS/6000;POWER architecture;Instruction Interpreter;Functional Simulator;Memory Simulator;interlock mechanism;fixed point pipeline","","","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system allocates the process with most data flows at the center of a 2-D grid space and effectively handles the positional preference for entities, processes, and data stores. The test cut function detects any crisscrossing of data flows and any cutting of DFD objects. The pop function pops up to those objects of high intersection weight to the upper layer under aesthetics optimization. This 3-D DFD contains only linear data flows with all crisscrossings eliminated. A noncutting connection between two objects can be seen clearly by rotating the 3-D DFD at every 90/spl deg/ step.

Amongst those implementations was /spl Gamma/CMC, an abstract machine for efficient implementation of lazy functional languages. /spl Gamma/CMC pioneered the transference of the control of the execution flow to C, as much as possible, to take advantage of the extremely low cost of procedure calls in modern RISC architectures. /spl Gamma/CMC was amongst the machines that presented good Pseudoknot figures, although it did not use some of the sophisticated optimisations of most of the other implementations. The experience of implementing Pseudoknot in /spl Gamma/CMC was most valuable in providing insights for new ways in optimising it.

As sensitive components in electronic devices, components on the PCB are easily damaged during a drop-impact process. While different PCB positions in the electronic devices can cause different stress and strain on the board, these impact behaviors can also make a difference to the force along the solders that connect the chips to the PCB. Through an existing FEA software tool, we can find an optimal position of the PCB on the electronic device to improve product quality. To illustrate the proposed method, the drop simulation of a PCB specimen mounted on a packaged TV product was performed. Dynamic modeling and simulation of drop test was established and presented. The position of the PCB was optimized through the proposed virtual boundary method. With the method, three optimization models were considered, and the designs were proven to successful by comparing the stress and deflection of concerned points on the PCB. It is also found that the method can quickly determine several PCB optimal positions in electronic devices directly by the magnitudes of the deflection and stress.","","0-7803-8205","10.1109/EPTC.2003.1271528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271528","","Stress;Circuit testing;Circuit simulation;Printed circuits;Electronic equipment testing;Performance evaluation;Assembly;Capacitive sensors;Software tools;Electronics packaging","electronics packaging;circuit simulation;optimisation;impact (mechanical);finite element analysis;television receivers;dynamic response;printed circuits","drop-impact analysis;virtual boundary model;electronic product PCB position optimization;electronic device assemblies;drop-impact process;board stress;board strain;FEA software tool;drop simulation;packaged TV product;dynamic modeling;PCB deflection","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An agent in MAGA represents a candidate solution to the optimization problem in hand. All agents live in a latticelike environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice-point. In order to increase energies, they compete or cooperate with their neighbors, and they can also use knowledge. Making use of these agent-agent interactions, MAGA realizes the purpose of minimizing the objective function value. Theoretical analyzes show that MAGA converges to the global optimum. In the first part of the experiments, ten benchmark functions are used to test the performance of MAGA, and the scalability of MAGA along the problem dimension is studied with great care. The results show that MAGA achieves a good performance when the dimensions are increased from 20-10,000. Moreover, even when the dimensions are increased to as high as 10,000, MAGA still can find high quality solutions at a low computational cost.

To accomplish this, the distributed scheduler agent needs to know the global load situation across all machines and be able to pick the host which best suits the specific resource requirements of individual jobs. Issues concerning the collecting and distribution of load information throughout the system are discussed. This load information is then fed to a ranking algorithm which uses a 3-dimensional load space to generate the most suitable host based on weights which indicate the relative importance of resources to a task.

This paper reports a quantitative study on the power-performance trade-offs in software pipelined schedules for an Itanium-like EPIC architecture with dual-speed pipelines, in which functional units are partitioned into fast ones and slow ones. We have developed an integer linear programming formulation to capture the power-performance tradeoffs for software pipelined loops. The proposed integer linear programming formulation and its solution method have been implemented and tested on a set of SPEC2000 benchmarks. The results are compared with an Itanium-like architecture (baseline) in which there are four functional units (FUs) and all of them are fast units. Our quantitative study reveals that by introducing a few slow FUs in place of fast FUs in the baseline architecture, the total energy consumed by FUs can be considerably reduced. When 2 out of 4 FUs are set as slow, the total energy consumed by FUs is reduced by up to 31.1% (with an average reduction of 25.2%) compared with the baseline configuration, while the performance degradation caused by using slow FUs is small. If performance demand is less critical, then energy reduction of up to 40.3% compared with the baseline configuration can be achieved.","1063-6404","0-7695-1700","10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106766","","Energy efficiency;Computer architecture;Integer linear programming;Energy consumption;Space exploration;Design optimization;Optimizing compilers;Processor scheduling;Pipelines;Testing","optimising compilers;performance evaluation;computer architecture;pipeline processing;parallel architectures;power consumption","power consumption;power-performance trade-offs;architecture design;space exploration;compiler optimizations;software pipelined schedules;microprocessors;EPIC architecture;integer linear programming","","1","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate the input and output values of basic blocks and find that these values can be quite regular and predictable, suggesting that using compiler support to extend value prediction and reuse to a coarser granularity may have substantial performance benefits. For the SPEC benchmark programs evaluated, 90% of the basic blocks have fewer than 4 register inputs, 5 live register outputs, 4 memory inputs and 2 memory outputs. About 16% to 41% of all the basic blocks are simply repeating earlier calculations when the programs are compiled with the -O2 optimization level in the GCC compiler. We evaluate the potential benefit of basic block reuse using a novel mechanism called a block history buffer. This mechanism records input and live output values of basic blocks to provide value prediction and reuse at the basic block level. Simulation results show that using a reasonably sized block history buffer to provide basic block reuse in a 4-way issue superscalar processor can improve execution time for the tested SPEC programs by 1% to 14% with an overall average of 9%.","","0-7695-0004","10.1109/HPCA.1999.744342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=744342","","Registers;Computer science;Computer aided instruction;Ear;Optimizing compilers;Program processors;History;Testing;Accuracy","parallel architectures;parallel programming;instruction sets;software reusability;program compilers;storage allocation;buffer storage","basic block value locality;block reuse;value prediction;instruction level;aggressive speculation;compiler support;coarser granularity;performance benefits;SPEC benchmark programs;register inputs;live register outputs;memory inputs;memory outputs;-O2 optimization level;GCC compiler;basic block reuse;block history buffer;4-way issue superscalar processor;execution time;SPEC programs","","30","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a network of airports involving hundreds of flights, it is difficult to determine the amount to hold each flight at the gate. This paper discusses how the optimization procedure simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) can be used to process delay cost measurements from air traffic simulation packages and produce an optimal gate holding schedule.

For a example, thermal control issues are a power subproblem with relevant time constants of millions of cycles or more, while the so-called dI/dT problem is also a power subproblem but occurs because of current variability on a much finer granularity: tens to hundreds of cycles. Likewise, for performance issues, program phase analysis for selecting simulation regions requires looking for periodicity on the order of millions of cycles or more, while some aspects of cache performance optimization requires understanding repetitive patterns on much finer granularities. Fourier analysis allows one to transform waveform into a sum of component (usually sinusoidal) waveforms in the frequency domain; in this way, the waveform's fundamental frequencies (periodicities of repetition) can be clearly identified. This paper shows how one can use Fourier analysis to produce frequency spectra for some of the time waveforms seen in processor execution. By working in the frequency domain, one can easily identify key application tendencies. For example, we demonstrate how to use spectral analysis to characterize the power behavior of real programs. As we show, this is useful for understanding both the temperature profile of a program and its voltage stability. These are particularly relevant issues for architects since thermal concerns and the dI/dT problem have significant influence on processor design. Frequency analysis can also be used to examine program performance. In particular, it can also identify periodic occurrences of important microarchitectural events like cache misses. Overall, the paper demonstrates the value of using frequency analysis in different research efforts related to characterizing and optimizing application performance and power.","","0-7803-8385","10.1109/ISPASS.2004.1291367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291367","","Spectral analysis;Performance analysis;Frequency domain analysis;Information analysis;Energy management;Pattern analysis;Analytical models;Optimization;Fourier transforms;Temperature","spectral analysis;Fourier analysis;program testing;software performance evaluation;power conversion","spectral analysis;program power characterization;program performance characterization;dI/dT problem;power subproblem;granularity;performance optimization;Fourier analysis;frequency domain;frequency analysis","","6","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It produces a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of a track, but resorts to a sampling technique within the tracking process to handle nonlinearity. GMMs are recovered from samples using the expectation-maximisation method. The approach has been implemented in PV-WAVE software and tested against a Kalman-filter tracker in a simulator with air-defence scenarios. Sample results are presented for a scenario with a single surveillance-radar and a single target following a weaving path. These show that the tracker produces significantly better position estimates and comparable heading and speed estimates. Computation times are about 30 times greater than for the Kalman-filter tracker, but there is scope for reducing that substantially by tolerating fewer samples.","","0-7803-3601","10.1109/ADFS.1996.581103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581103","","Bayesian methods;Target tracking;Sampling methods;Economic forecasting;Linearity;Software testing;Weaving;State estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Probability distribution","target tracking;tracking;Bayes methods;noise;statistical analysis;optimisation","parametric techniques;nonparametric techniques;Bayesian target tracking;nonlinear nonGaussian noise target tracking;Gaussian mixture model;nonlinearity;expectation-maximisation method;PV-WAVE software;Kalman-filter tracker;air-defence scenarios;surveillance radar","","3","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On-line partial discharge measurements provide information about progressing degradation under operational stress or defects which are only excited by the operational stress (e.g. vibration of e.g. motors). Thus, a complementary insight in the state of the apparatus can be gained which is not accessible through off-line testing. Provided a ""diagnostic connector"" or sensor is integrated into or attached to the high voltage system, periodic measurements, trend recording or even on-line monitoring becomes possible. Digital partial discharge measurements with enhanced signal conditioning techniques allow better visualization and interpretation of data in terms of risk and defect type and provide better noise reduction and identification capabilities. They are not only applied to the R&D environment, but are today used in quality assurance and online situations. The interpretation of digital pd measurements not only includes the defect assessment (physics of partial discharge) but also an identification of noise sources and non-pd signals.

This paper introduces two methods that are able to combat both degradations, yet allow the receiver to remain as simple as a single user receiver for a perfect channel. For mild multipath channels, the performance of the algorithms is excellent, within a few decibels of the single user ideal channel case, at the cost of additional computation at the base station at which complete knowledge of the channels and the receiver codewords is required. One method, the decorrelating prefilter, is most flexible and applicable to existing systems yet less powerful than other previously published methods. The second, the jointly optimized sequences algorithm, has a performance on average superior to published methods. In addition to theoretical analysis and simulation of the algorithms' potential, these algorithms have also been implemented and tested on a software radio testbed and experimental data are shown. The jointly optimized sequences performed particularly well even in severe multipath and multiuser interference environments.","0733-8716;1558-0008","","10.1109/49.840200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840200","","Signal processing algorithms;Multiaccess communication;Signal processing;Radio transmitters;Software algorithms;Software testing;Communication systems;Interference suppression;Multiuser detection;Degradation","code division multiple access;radio links;land mobile radio;radio transmitters;interference suppression;multipath channels;decorrelation;filtering theory;optimisation;spread spectrum communication;indoor radio;wireless LAN;multiuser channels","transmitter-based multiuser interference rejection;multipath effects;wireless CDMA system;multipath environment;direct sequence code division multiple access;down-link signal processing;receiver;perfect channel;multipath channels;algorithm performance;single user ideal channel;base station;receiver codewords;decorrelating prefilter;jointly optimized sequences algorithm;simulation;software radio testbed;experimental data;indoor wireless LAN","","71","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The results show that TREAT almost always outperforms Rete. TREAT requires less storage than Rete, and is less sensitive to optimization decisions than Rete. Based on these results, it is concluded that TREAT is the preferred algorithm for testing join conditions of database rules. Since Rete does outperform TREAT in some cases, this study suggests a next step which would be to develop a hybrid version of Rete and TREAT with an optimizer that would decide which strategy to use based on the rule definition and statistics about the data and update patterns.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-2545","10.1109/ICDE.1992.213202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=213202","","System testing;Production systems;Design optimization;Context modeling;Relational databases;Statistical analysis;Process design;Computer science;Military computing;Application software","database theory;deductive databases;digital simulation;knowledge based systems;performance evaluation","performance simulation comparison;Rete algorithm;TREAT algorithm;data patterns;database rule conditions;production rule condition testing algorithms;database rule system;join conditions;rule definition;update patterns","","10","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The QAP is NP-hard and therefore no algorithms are known for solving the QAP in polynomial time. For this reason a variety of heuristic methods have been proposed for this problem. In order to evaluate heuristics, Palubetskis proposed an algorithm that generates QAPs with known optimal solution value. We show in this paper that given a Palubetskis instance (but not its optimal value) the corresponding optimal value can be determined via a linear program, polynomial in the input data, i.e., in polynomial time. This implies that problems generated by the Palubetskis method belong to a simple and degenerate subclass of QAPs and are therefore not appropriate for algorithm testing. The proof technique suggests moreover a new lower bound for Euclidean QAPs.<<ETX>>","1057-7122;1558-1268","","10.1109/81.298362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=298362","","Polynomials;Transmission line matrix methods;Cost function;Distributed computing;Testing;Minimization;Linear matrix inequalities;Symmetric matrices;Application software;Resource management","optimisation;resource allocation;heuristic programming;linear programming;matrix algebra;polynomials;combinatorial mathematics","quadratic assignment problems;Palubetskis algorithm;degenerate problems;combinatorial optimization problem;resource allocation;NP-hard;heuristic methods;known optimal solution value;linear program;polynomial time;Euclidean QAPs","","2","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The platform transforms any echograph into a test-system for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques. A particular user interface was designed in order to allow a real-time and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure. This is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm. The most important platform aspect, which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems, is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal, which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasound-media interaction phenomenon. The platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer (PC) giving rise to several benefits, such as the quick technological evolution in the PC field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications.

The P/sup 3/T automatically computes at compile time a set of parallel program parameters which predict the outcome of three of the most crucial performance aspects of parallel programs: work distribution, communication overhead, and data locality. After analyzing the strengths and [imitations of the performance estimator, experiments are shown that demonstrate the ability of the P/sup 3/T to successfully guide both programmer and compiler in the search for efficient data distribution strategies and program transformations.

"Development and testing of a reliability performance index for modular robotic systems","D. L. Schneider; D. Tesar; J. W.

Two criteria for modules integration not previously investigated are the reliability and accuracy of the system. This paper presents the results of the development of a framework for a ""criterion"" embodying these two modular robot characteristics. Using a probabilistic representation of manipulator kinematics and a reliability block diagram model of the manipulator system, a reliability performance index (RPI) representing the probability of no hardware or software failure and the manipulator achieving a specified position and orientation is developed. The RPI is tested with a case study consisting of a three degree-of-freedom planar manipulator assembled from a choice of six joint modules of varying reliability and precision and a choice of six link module combinations of varying lengths and machining tolerances. A straight-line, square trajectory is specified and the RPI is calculated for each combination of joint modules and links, a total of 1296 different combinations. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on the results using the different joint locations and link options as factors and the different joint modules and link options as factor levels. The different factors are tested for significance and the Tukey Studentized Range Test is performed to determine significance of the different joint modules and link options. Using this statistical testing, a 70% reduction in the module design space is achieved using the RPI. Optimization using other appropriate manipulator criteria can then be performed to generate the final configuration. Additional extensive case studies are needed to fully develop the RPI to a stage necessary for implementation into a computer-aided design system for modular robot configuration design. The RPI may also be useful in the quantification of the overall system reliability and performance of any system based upon measured error, such as control systems.<<ETX>>","","0-7803-1786","10.1109/RAMS.1994.291118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=291118","","Testing;Performance analysis;Economic indicators;Manipulators;Robots;Analysis of variance;Kinematics;Hardware;Software performance;Assembly","reliability;statistical analysis;kinematics;performance index","reliability performance index;modular robotic systems;fully functional robot system;accuracy;probabilistic representation;manipulator kinematics;reliability block diagram model;three degree-of-freedom planar manipulator;straight-line square trajectory;analysis of variance;ANOVA;Tukey Studentized Range Test;joint modules;link options;statistical testing;configuration design","","10","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To test this intuition, we analyze the behavior of several existing medium-grain applications on a wide-area multicluster. We find that high performance can be obtained if the programs are optimized to take the multilevel network structure into account. The optimizations reduce intercluster traffic and hide intercluster latency, and substantially improve performance on wide area multiclusters.

This research develops a new solution approach to determine the component placement sequence and feeder arrangement for a turret style surface mount-placement machine often used in PCB assembly systems. This solution approach can be integrated into a process planning system to reduce assembly time and improve productivity. The algorithm consists of a construction procedure that uses a set of rules to generate an initial component placement sequence and feeder arrangement along with an improvement procedure to improve the initial solution. An industrial case study conducted at Ericsson, Inc., using a Fuji CP4-3 machine and actual PCB data, is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution approach. The solutions obtained using the proposed solution approach are compared to those obtained using state of the art PCB assembly process optimization software. For all PCBs in the case study, the proposed solution approach yielded lower placement times than the commercial software, thus generating additional valuable production capacity.

Eng., Western Australia Univ., Nedlands, WA, Australia","IEE Proceedings - Generation, Transmission and Distribution","","1995","142","3","240","246","The paper reports new developments in computational methods for evaluating the normal cyclic rating (NCR) and long-term emergency rating (LTER) of transformers. It makes two major improvements to the procedures given in the international standard in the subject: IEC354. One improvement derives from an interpretation of NCR and LTER formulations as a constrained optimisation procedure. Starting from a given load profile, the procedure maximises transformer loading levels subject to constraints formed from maximum values of permissible internal temperatures and of a defined insulation ageing factor. The second advance is based on a separation of variables in the evaluation of the integral which gives the relative ageing factor. This measure makes major savings in the computing overheads of practical evaluations. The two developments together lead to reliable procedures for NCR or LTER evaluations in practice as encountered in a power authority or utility. They can be relied on to give a solution without user intervention. Convergence to a solution is independent of the transformer thermal characteristics relevant to rating studies and of the loading profiles for which they are carried out. The results summarise some of the studies used in validating a comprehensive software system that implements the procedures which the paper reports. The new procedures have been tested and compared with existing procedures for many practical cases and found to achieve significant advantage, sometimes dramatically so.<<ETX>>","1350-2360","","10.1049/ip-gtd:19951746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=388356","","Aging;Optimization methods;Power transformer insulation;Power transformers;Standards","ageing;optimisation;power transformer insulation;power transformers;standards","cyclic loading;power transformers;constrained optimisation procedure;normal cyclic rating;long-term emergency rating;IEC354;international standard;load profile;internal temperatures;insulation ageing factor;relative ageing factor;software system","","2","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Once transformed, aperiodic tasks are handled in exactly the same way as periodic tasks with hard deadlines. The proposed algorithm is shown to be optimal in terms of providing the shortest aperiodic response time among fixed and dynamic priority schedulers. It always guarantees the proper execution of periodic hard tasks. The approach is composed of two parts: an offline analysis and a run time scheduler. The offline algorithm runs in pseudopolynomial time O(mn), where n is the number of hard periodic tasks and m is the hyperperiod/min deadline.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/32.601081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=601081","","Scheduling algorithm;Dynamic scheduling;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Testing;Delay;Timing;Computer Society;Runtime","scheduling;real-time systems;minimisation;computational complexity;distributed algorithms","optimal algorithm;soft aperiodic task scheduling;dynamic priority preemptive systems;soft real time constraints;priority preemptive dispatcher;EDF policy;online algorithm;acceptor algorithm;aperiodic work load servicing;hard deadlines;aperiodic response time;dynamic priority schedulers;periodic hard tasks;offline analysis;run time scheduler;pseudopolynomial time;earliest deadline first","","24","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Grotker","Aachen Univ. of Technol., Germany; Aachen Univ. of Technol., Germany","Proceedings of European Design and Test Conference EDAC-ETC-EUROASIC","","1994","","","672","","The system and architecture design of digital receivers for high to medium throughput communication links and similar signal processing hardware has special characteristics. The algorithm development on the system level is performed using a data flow driven simulation tool. To shorten the turn-around time in the joint optimization of algorithm and architecture we developed the concept of a tool and library support for a smooth direct transition from the untimed system level dynamic data flow specification and simulation to a synchronous timed ASIC implementation using a hardware description language. Multiple and dynamic data rates can be converted. To reuse design knowledge a library of several generic implementations is provided, which should allow to cover various trade-offs for the particular functions. The timing interface of the library allows for introduction of timing and implementation-dependent information in terms of data rates, iteration intervals (i.e. the number of clock cycles between two data items), port related latencies and control conditions (for models with dynamic rates). The system incorporates algorithms for checking whether the system is consistent and deadlock-free as well as the computation of the arrival times for the data items on the edges. The main task in the implementation of the dynamic data flow is the automatic creation of the gated clock or control signal system to enable the correct setting of algorithmic states in the system. Furthermore algorithms for detecting the registers representing the algorithmic states (which are different from pipeline registers when dealing with dynamic subgraphs) and deciding on the feasibility of the implementation have been developed.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-5410","10.1109/EDTC.1994.326923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=326923","","Synchronous generators;Signal processing algorithms;Libraries;Timing;Clocks;Automatic control;Signal design;Throughput;Digital signal processing;Hardware","digital communication systems;receivers;application specific integrated circuits;specification languages;parallel processing;signal processing equipment;data communication equipment;circuit CAD;software tools;signal processing","synchronous timed descriptions;digital receivers;dynamic data flow;architecture design;communication links;signal processing hardware;data flow driven simulation tool;turn-around time;joint optimization;smooth direct transition;synchronous timed ASIC implementation;hardware description language;timing interface;data rates;iteration intervals;lock cycles;port related latencies;control conditions;deadlock-free;arrival times;gated clock","","6","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to validate the established mathematical models as well as the software package, the transient stability of the New England test power network was studied. The results obtained with the hybrid formulation were compared with the solutions produced by a time domain simulation program and show a very close agreement. Consequently, the proposed technique classifies correctly, without any dangerous diagnostic or false alarm, all the analysed situations. In addition, this approach provides the transient stability margins as well as the critical machines of the severe contingencies, therefore enabling further design of corrective security actions. Finally, some conclusions that provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of the transient stability assessment of a multimachine power system are pointed out.","","0-7803-7527","10.1109/MELECON.2002.1014584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1014584","","Power system security;Power system transients;Power system stability;Power system analysis computing;Power system control;Power system simulation;Power system interconnection;Power systems;Power system planning;Power system relaying","power system transient stability;power system control;power system security;power system simulation;time-domain analysis","on-line security;on-line contingency screening;on-line contingency ranking;transient stability assessment;hybrid method;TRANsySTEM software package;robust approach;time domain integration schemes;initial system trajectory;equal area criterion;computer programs;New England test power network;time domain simulation program;power system control;transient stability margins;critical machines;corrective security actions;multimachine power system","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The studied SIMD instruction set extensions include Intel's SSE family, AMD's 3DNow!, Motorola's AltiVec, and IBM's BlueGene/L SIMD instructions. FFTW, ATLAS, and SPIRAL demonstrate that near-optimal performance of numerical kernels across a variety of modern computers featuring deep memory hierarchies can be achieved only by means of automatic performance tuning. These software packages generate and optimize ANSI C code and feed it into the target machine's general-purpose C compiler to maintain portability. The scalar C code produced by performance tuning systems poses a severe challenge for vectorizing compilers. The particular code structure hampers automatic vectorization and, thus, inhibits satisfactory performance on processors featuring short vector extensions. This paper describes special-purpose compiler technology that supports automatic performance tuning on machines with vector instructions. The work described includes: 1) symbolic vectorization of digital signal processing transforms; 2) straight-line code vectorization for numerical kernels; and 3) compiler back ends for straight-line code with vector instructions. Methods from all three areas were combined with FFTW, SPIRAL, and ATLAS to optimize both for memory hierarchy and vector instructions. Experiments show that the presented methods lead to substantial speedups (up to 1.8 for two-way and 3.3 for four-way vector extensions) over the best scalar C codes generated by the original systems as well as roughly matching the performance of hand-tuned vendor libraries.","0018-9219;1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.840491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386659","Automatic vectorization;digital signal processing (DSP);fast Fourier transform (FFT);short vector single instruction, multiple data (SIMD);symbolic vectorization","Computer aided instruction;Kernel;Digital signal processing;Parallel processing;Spirals;Boosting;Computer applications;Signal processing algorithms;Registers;Concurrent computing","instruction sets;parallel programming;software libraries;mathematics computing;operating system kernels;software packages;parallelising compilers;software portability","SIMD extensions;single instruction multiple data parallelism;automatic performance tuning;multilayered memory hierarchies;Abbreviated Test Language for Avionic Systems;numerical kernels;software packages;ANSI C code;American National Standards Institute;C compiler;software portability;vectorizing compilers;automatic vectorization;short vector extensions;special purpose compiler technology;vector instructions;digital signal processing transforms;straight line code vectorization;compiler back ends;hand tuned vendor libraries;performance tuning systems","","18","54","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The formers suspect the existence of a structure in the solved problem and that structure can occur in other problems. The latters fear that heuristics are especially adapted for the testbed problem this paper addresses structural aspect of combinatorial optimization problems. In a first time, we recall some related works which provide a frame to our work. Particularly, we recall the existence of deceptive problems which are proved to be hard to optimize, the definitions of the five scenarios of knowledge in optimization problem, and some works which already discuss the reach of NFL theorem. In the next part, we give a short overview of how NFL works and discuss its significance with regards to complexity. This leads to the observation that the notion of structure of optimization problems is missing in NFL use. Then, we prove that k-coloring problems respect such a notion of structure, for any k. In the last part we discuss the relevance of our work on four points: the polynomial reduction of NP-complete problems and structure preservation, the connection between our work and the study which squeeze NFL using neighborhood search operators, the position of our study on the five scenarios of knowledge, and finally the difference between metaheuristics and heuristics.","","0-7803-8515","10.1109/CEC.2004.1330860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1330860","","Testing;Polynomials;NP-complete problem;Logic;Information theory;Compression algorithms;Mathematics;Data compression;Optimization methods;Application software","computational complexity;optimisation;combinatorial mathematics;search problems;graph colouring","NFL theorem;structured problem classes;heuristic;metaheuristics;No Free Lunch theorem;testbed problem;combinatorial optimization problems;optimization problem;computational complexity;k-coloring problems;polynomial reduction;NP-complete problems;structure preservation;neighborhood search operators;heuristics","","3","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lee and J.B. Thomas (ibid., vol.IT-30, no.1, p.16-23, Jan. 1984), is generalized for application to the case of multiple hypotheses with different means/variances of the Gaussian distribution. The method constitutes a two-threshold test for fixed-size packages of samples with a sequential procedure of discarding the package for which no decision is reached and subsequently testing a new package. The objective is to find an optimum package size N/sub 0/ which leads to the minimum overall average sample number (ASN) for a given overall error probability. An optimization algorithm is developed to extend the application of the Lee-Thomas procedure to the M-ary case. Performance characteristics of the generalized two-threshold (GTT) test procedure are compared with those of conventional sequential as well as fixed-sample-size (FSS) methods. It is shown for the M-ary different means/variances cases that for low error rates the number of samples required by the GTT test is, on the average, approximately half that needed by a FSS test. However, it is somewhat more than the ASN obtained with a conventional sequential test. With decreasing error probabilities the GTT test performance approaches that of conventional sequential methods.<<ETX>>","0018-9448;1557-9654","","10.1109/18.2650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=2650","","Packaging;Testing;Sequential analysis;Error probability;Gaussian distribution;Frequency selective surfaces;Error analysis;Councils;Information theory;Application software","information theory","information theory;generalized two-threshold detection procedure;sequential procedure;multiple hypotheses;Gaussian distribution;optimum package size;average sample number;optimization algorithm;M-ary case;test procedure","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In all these applications, transformation algorithms are constructed by hand for each different transformation goal. Loosely speaking, a transformation algorithm defines a sequence of transformation steps to apply to a given program. It is notoriously hard to find good transformation sequences automatically, and so much (costly) human intervention is required. This work shows how search-based meta-heuristic algorithms can be used to automate, or partly automate the problem of finding good transformation sequences. In this case, the goal of transformation is to reduce program size, but the approach is sufficiently general that it can be used to optimize any source-code level metric. The search techniques used are random search (RS), hill climbing (HC) and genetic algorithms (GA). The paper reports the result of initial experiments on small synthetic program transformation problems. The results are encouraging.

A systems engineer analyzes and optimizes an ensemble of elements that relate to the flow of energy, mass and communications into a design that performs the desired function. ""Systems engineering"" is used herein to cover a very broad spectrum of processes and controls to engineer a product at the many levels required to satisfy all aspects of the original requirement. Our definition is not intended to either include or exclude systems engineering and integration as used in the computer field. In any case, systems engineering is the application of solid engineering principles to design and develop a large enterprise within cost and schedule to satisfy the needs of the ultimate user.

Support-set finding methods to build local BDDs have been proposed to handle large circuits.

To solve this problem, we propose a new algorithm, Feather algorithm, which can efficiently detect minimal support-set with 100% reconvergent node detection rate.

SPECjbb2005 is a substantial update to SPECjbb2000, intended to make the workload more representative based on current Java development practices. SPECjbb2000 has been in existence for about five years and it has been a valuable tool for optimizing the performance of commercial JVMs as well as supporting research activities. Since SPECjbb2005 replaces SPECjbb2000, it is important to understand the key differences between the two, as well as implications for JVM and hardware designers. In this paper, we present a comparative characterization of these two workloads based on detailed measurements on an Intel/spl reg/ Xeon/spl trade/ processor-based commercial server. First, we describe key functional changes introduced in SPECjbb2005. Using low-intrusion application profiling tools we compare application execution profiles. Through JVM monitoring tools, we compare JVM behavior including JIT optimization and garbage collection. Using operating system monitoring tools we compare key system level metrics including CPU utilization. With the aid of processor performance monitoring events, we compare key architectural characteristics such as cache miss rates, memory/bus utilization, and branch behavior. Finally, we summarize key findings, provide recommendations to JVM developers and hardware designers, and suggest areas for future work.","","0-7803-9461","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526002","","Java;Hardware;Monitoring;Operating systems;Scalability;Libraries;Measurement;Productivity;Runtime environment;Optimizing compilers","software performance evaluation;benchmark testing;Java;storage management;system monitoring;software metrics","multilevel comparative performance characterization;SPECjbb2005;SPECjbb2000;server-side Java benchmark;Intel Xeon processor-based commercial server;low-intrusion application profiling tools;JVM monitoring tools;JIT optimization;garbage collection;operating system monitoring tools;system level metrics;CPU utilization;processor performance monitoring events;cache miss rates;memory utilization;bus utilization;branch behavior","","2","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the key advantages fingerprinting-based intellectual property protection (IPP) has over watermarking-based IPP is the enabling of tracing stolen hardware or software. Fingerprinting schemes have been widely and effectively used to achieve this goal; however, their application domain has been restricted only to static artifacts, such as image and audio, where distinct copies can be obtained easily. In this paper, we propose the first generic fingerprinting technique that can be applied to an arbitrary synthesis (optimization or decision) or compilation problem and, therefore to hardware and software IPs. The key problem with design IP fingerprinting is that there is a need to generate a large number of structurally unique but functionally and timing identical designs. To reduce the cost of generating such distinct copies, we apply iterative optimization in an incremental fashion to solve a fingerprinted instance. Therefore, we leverage on the optimization effort already spent in obtaining previous solutions, yet we generate a uniquely fingerprinted new solution. This generic approach is the basis for developing specific fingerprinting techniques for four important problems in VLSI CAD: partitioning, graph coloring, satisfiability, and standard-cell placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new fingerprinting-based IPP techniques on a number of standard benchmarks.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2003.822126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262458","","Fingerprint recognition;Intellectual property;Hardware;Iterative methods;Protection;Watermarking;Application software;Timing;Cost function;Very large scale integration","industrial property;iterative methods;optimisation;VLSI;benchmark testing;integrated circuit design","iterative techniques;design IP fingerprinting;fingerprinting-based intellectual property protection;watermarking-based IPP;static artifacts;arbitrary synthesis;decision;compilation problem;hardware IP;software IP;iterative optimization;VLSI CAD;partitioning;graph coloring;satisfiability;standard-cell placement;benchmarking","","32","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"P-3PC: a point-to-point communication model for automatic and optimal decomposition of regular domain problems","F. J. Seinstra; D. Koelma","Intelligent Sensory Inf. Syst., Amsterdam Univ., Netherlands; Intelligent Sensory Inf. Syst., Amsterdam Univ., Netherlands","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","2002","13","7","758","768","One of the most fundamental problems automatic parallelization tools are confronted with is to find an optimal domain decomposition for a given application. For regular domain problems (such as simple matrix manipulations), this task may seem trivial. However, communication costs in message-passing programs often depend significantly on the memory layout of data blocks to be transmitted. As a consequence, straightforward domain decompositions may be non-optimal. In this paper, we introduce a new point-to-point communication model, called P-3PC (Parameterized model based on the Three Paths of Communication), that is specifically designed to overcome this problem. In comparison with related models (e.g. LogGP), P-3PC is similar in complexity, but more accurate in many situations. Although the model is aimed at MPI's standard point-to-point operations, it is applicable to similar message-passing definitions as well. The effectiveness of the model is tested in a framework for automatic parallelization of low-level image processing applications. Experiments are performed on two Beowulf-type systems, each having a different interconnection network and a different MPI implementation. The results show that, where other models frequently fail, P-3PC correctly predicts the communication costs related to any type of domain decomposition.","1045-9219;1558-2183;2161-9883","","10.1109/TPDS.2002.1019863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019863","","Costs;Message passing;Image processing;Matrix decomposition;Automatic testing;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Predictive models;Optimization;Software performance;Software design","application program interfaces;message passing;software performance evaluation;image processing;problem solving;multiprocessor interconnection networks;communication complexity","P-3PC;point-to-point communication model;automatic optimal domain decomposition;regular domain problems;automatic parallelization tools;matrix manipulations;communication costs;message-passing programs;memory layout;data block transmission;parameterized model;communication paths;complexity;accuracy;MPI;automatic parallelization;low-level image processing applications;Beowulf-type systems;interconnection networks;performance optimization;performance modeling","","9","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SiP designs are typically only attempted when a wall is reached -such as size or performance constraints and conventional system-on-chip (SoC) solutions are too expensive to implement. SoC involves accessing and working with one design/technology library and partitioning decisions are highly dependent on the library construction and routing capabilities that are identified within the software. The higher integration capacity of SiP reduces the number of components in the system and reduces the size and routing complexity of the printed circuit board. SiP design challenges arise due to the lack of similar design infrastructure between semiconductor technologies and the multitude of layout possibilities. Packaging concepts include chip stacked on chip, flip chip stacked on chip, chips placed side by side in a package, among other concepts which complicate the design partitioning process. This paper discusses these challenges to optimizing system design.","","0-7803-7842","10.1109/CICC.2003.1249482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249482","","System-on-a-chip;Integrated circuit interconnections;Routing;Testing;Libraries;Semiconductor device packaging;Application software;Cost function;Electromagnetic compatibility;CMOS technology","system-on-chip;integrated circuit design;chip scale packaging;flip-chip devices;multichip modules","system-in-package;system-on-chip;SiP integration capacity;software routing capabilities;software library construction;SoC;multi-technology designs;design partitioning;printed circuit board routing complexity;stacked chip packaging;flip chip packaging;system design optimization","","8","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is based on the conditional independence assumption that it is often violated in applications. In addition, in many real-world data mining applications, however, an accurate ranking of instances is often required rather than an accurate classification. For example, a ranking of customers in terms of the likelihood that they buy one's products is useful in direct marketing. In this paper, we firstly investigate the ranking performance of some lazy learning algorithms for extending naive Bayes. The ranking performance is measured by Hand and Till (2001) and Bradley (1997). We observe that they can not significantly improve naive Bayes' ranking performance. Motivated by this fact and aiming at improving naive Bayes with accurate ranking, we present a new lazy learning algorithm, called lazy naive Bayes (simply LNB), to extend naive Bayes for ranking. We experimentally tested our algorithm, using the whole 36 UCI data sets (Blake and Merz, 2000) recommended by Weka, and compared it to NB and C4.4 (Provost and Domingos, 2003) measured by AUC.

Although most programmers naturally program in a structured fashion, there remain many important programs and benchmarks that include some number of goto statements, thus rendering the entire program unstructured. Such unstructured programs cannot be handled with compilers built with analyses and transformations for structured programs. In this paper we present a straight-forward algorithm to structure C programs by eliminating all goto statements. The method works directly on a high-level abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the program and could easily be integrated into any compiler that uses an AST-based intermediate representation. The actual algorithm proceeds by eliminating each goto by first applying a sequence of goto-movement transformations followed by the appropriate goto-elimination transformation. We have implemented the method in the McCAT (McGill Compiler Architecture Testbed) optimizing/parallelizing C compiler and we present experimental results that demonstrate that the method is both efficient and effective.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-5640","10.1109/ICCL.1994.288377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=288377","","Program processors;Optimizing compilers;Programming profession;Switches;Computer science;Design optimization;Software testing;Software engineering;Information analysis;Flow graphs","program compilers;C language;parallel programming","goto statements;control flow;parallelizing compilers;optimizing compilers;C programs;high-level abstract syntax tree;AST representation;intermediate representation;goto-movement transformations;goto-elimination;McCAT;McGill Compiler Architecture Testbed","","17","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One reason is the high cost of developing, testing, and installing protocol implementations. To reduce this difficulty, protocols are developed and executed within environments called protocol subsystems, and protocol software is often ported instead of being coded from scratch. Unfortunately, today a variety of protocol subsystems offer a plethora of features, functionality, and drawbacks; the differences among them often reduce the portability and reusability of protocol code, and therefore present barriers to the deployment of new protocols. In this paper, we consider differences in subsystems and their effect on the portability and reusability of protocols and protocol implementations. We then propose two different approaches, each optimized for a different situation, that allow protocol code implemented in one subsystem to be used without modification within other subsystems, and thus reduce the barriers to protocol deployment.

IEEE ICIT '02.","","2002","1","","193","198 vol.1","Presents the algorithms to simulate nonlinear kinematics of a 5-axis milling machine. The simulator is based on 3D representation and employing the inverse kinematics approach to derive the corresponding rotational and translation movement of the mechanism. The simulator makes it possible to analyze the accuracy of a 3D tool-path based on a prescribed set of the cutter location (CL) points as well as a set of the cutter contact (CC) points with tool inclination angle. The resulting trajectory of the tool is not unique and depends on the initial set up of the machine which in turn is problem dependent. Furthermore, the simulator can be used to simulate the milling process, verify the final cut and estimate the errors of the actual tool-path before the real workpiece is actually being tested with the real machine.

One of the novelties in BDL is its seamless integration into the Unified Modeling Language approach (UML). BDL supports a description of objects interaction which respects both the functional architecture of system designs and the declarative style of diagram descriptions. This support is implemented by means of a partial-order theoretical framework. This framework allows to specify both the causality and the control models of object interactions independently of any hypothesis on the actual configuration of the system. Given the description of such a configuration, the use of BDL offers new perspectives for a flexible verification of systems by modeling them as an asynchronous network of synchronous components. It allows an optimized code generation by using compilation techniques developed for synchronous languages. It permits an accurate validation and test of applications by supporting the manipulation of both causal and control dependencies. BDL aims at maximizing the re-usability of high-level specifications while minimizing programming effort and test-case based validation of distributed systems.","","0-8186-8430","10.1109/ISORC.1998.666789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=666789","","Electrical capacitance tomography;Unified modeling language;System testing;Software systems;Engineering management;Software engineering;Software testing;Natural languages;Computers;Proposals","distributed processing;specification languages;formal verification","distributed reactive objects;Behaviour Description Language;BDL;specifying;verifying;compiling;validating;object-oriented distributed reactive systems;distributed systems","","4","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The programming of the device will be drawn from a narrower set of applications with execution that persists in the system over a longer period of time than for general purpose programming. But the devices will still be programmable, not only at the level of the individual processing element, but across multiple processing elements and even the entire chip. The design of other programmable single chip computers has enjoyed an era where the design trade-offs could be captured in simulators such as SimpleScalar and performance could be evaluated to the SPEC benchmarks.

The Moore machine and the behaviors specified by temporal logic are the inputs of the Model Checker, which is able to verify the properties of liveness and fairness. During the transformation, local and global behaviors of the Petri net model are separated, which means that a certain modularity can be achieved. An optimization technique is presented to trim the unnecessary local information from the local reachability graphs. The space complexity of manipulating the global reachability graph, which is generated by combing the trimmed local reachability graph, can be reduced.

The example analyzed in the paper was suggested by a typical application of electrostatic separation technique in the recycling industry: the selective sorting of metals and insulating materials from chopped wire and cable waste. The objective was to maximize the benefits from the recycling of both constituents of a binary copper-polyvinyl chloride granular mixture. A preliminary set of electrostatic separation tests, performed on a custom-designed laboratory unit, guided the choice of the starting values of the parameters considered in the computer-assisted experimental procedure of process optimization. The results of a first experiment, carried out in conformity with a fractional factorial scheme, were used for the computation of the coefficients of a linear mathematical model of the electrostatic process. The model was then employed to predict the values of the operating variables for which the optimum of the process is attained. A second experiment was performed in order to confirm the accuracy of the prediction.

In this article, based on the method of Zaridze, an adaptive antenna with improved polarization properties is suggested due to the use, instead of a dielectric, chiral medium. A software package for computation and visualization of characteristics of such an antenna is presented and demonstrated. The interaction of antenna with the outside lossy dielectric body is also simulated and evaluated. The antenna considered is represented as an aggregate of linear sources imbedded in partially screened chiral medium of the given shape, dimensions and material properties. The number of excitation sources, their amplitudes, phases and situations, as well as wavenumber of excitation are the input parameters for the user. One can also choose the shape of antenna, its dimensions, undercoat material parameters and percent of the screened boundary. The lossy dielectric body, simulating the human head attached to the antenna, is also included in this scheme. The user may specify dimensions and complex permittivity of dielectric body, as well as its disposition with respect to the antenna. The created software package has been tested in a wide frequency range and for different geometrical, material and excitation parameters. The efficiency of software package to compute and optimize parameters of adaptive antenna alone or in the presence of lossy dielectric body is also demonstrated.","","0-7803-6428","10.1109/AEM.2000.943284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943284","","Portable computers;Adaptive arrays;Dielectric losses;Software packages;Shape;Dielectric materials;Polarization;Visualization;Computational modeling;Aggregates","mobile antennas;adaptive antenna arrays;chirality;inhomogeneous media;dielectric bodies;electromagnetic wave polarisation;software packages;electrical engineering computing;absorbing media","portable adaptive antenna;chiral coating;linear sources;screened dielectric;polarization properties;software package;dielectric chiral medium;partially screened chiral medium;excitation sources;antenna dimensions;undercoat material parameters;human head;complex permittivity;lossy dielectric body","","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conference and Exhibition 2001","","2001","","","735","740","This research examines the role of dynamically reconfigurable logic in systems-on-a-chip (SoC) design. Specifically we study the overhead of storing and downloading the configuration code bits for different parts of an application in a dynamically reconfigurable coprocessor environment. For SoC designs the different configuration bit-streams will likely need to be stored on chip, thus it becomes crucial to reduce the storage overhead. In addition, reducing the reconfiguration time overhead is crucial in realizing performance benefits. This study provides insight into the granularity of the reconfigurable logic that is appropriate for the SoC context. Our initial study is in the domain of multimedia and communication systems. We first present profiling results for these using the MESCAL compiler infrastructure. These results are used to derive an architecture template that consists of dynamically reconfigurable datapaths using coarse grain logic blocks and a reconfigurable interconnection network. We justify this template based on the constraints of SoC design. We then describe a design flow where we start from an application, derive the kernel loops via profiling and then map the application using the dynamically reconfigurable datapath and the simplest interconnection network. As part of this flow we have developed a mapping algorithm that minimizes the size of the interconnection network and thus the overhead of reconfiguration, which is key for systems-on-a-chip. We provide some initial results that validate our approach.","1530-1591","0-7695-0993","10.1109/DATE.2001.915110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915110","","Reconfigurable logic;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;System-on-a-chip;Coprocessors;Programmable logic arrays;Programmable logic devices;Kernel;Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Design methodology","hardware-software codesign;reconfigurable architectures;coprocessors;embedded systems;program compilers;integrated circuit design","systems-on-a-chip design;dynamic reconfiguration overhead management;reconfigurable datapaths;optimized interconnection networks;dynamically reconfigurable logic;configuration code bits;coprocessor environment;logic granularity;MESCAL compiler infrastructure;architecture template;coarse grain logic blocks;design flow;kernel loops;mapping algorithm","","16","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An eBlock network can be viewed as a basic form of sensor network that can be developed by non-programming engineers, scientists, and others. Each eBlock has a defined function, either one of a few predefined combinational or sequential functions, a custom-programmed function defined by an automated tool, or by user with programming skills. A user creates an application simply by connecting blocks, and possibly performing simple configuration via dials and switches. We have built over 100 physical eBlock prototypes, and tested their usability with over 100 non-programming users to date. We will describe the architecture of the blocks, including design tradeoffs we considered and the benefit of an exploration tool that we developed to help optimize the power and performance of the design. We have also built a graphical eBlock simulator that users can utilize to quickly build and test systems before deployment, and that we have used in experiments with over 300 non-programming users to help us define intuitive block functions and interfaces. We will describe the simulator architecture, as well as a tool that automatically converts a user's eBlock network into a much smaller network of programmable blocks with accompanying automatically generated programs.","","0-7803-9201","10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440960","","Sensor systems;Embedded system;Automatic programming;Functional programming;Joining processes;Switches;Prototypes;Testing;Usability;Design optimization","embedded systems;actuators;graphical user interfaces;computer graphics;optimisation;combinatorial mathematics;software tools;wireless sensor networks","embedded system building block;graphical eBlocks simulator;sensor network;nonprogramming engineers;combinational function;sequential function;custom-programmed function;automated tool;programming skills;optimization","","3","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It identifies repeated code segments (a generalization of basic blocks to directed rooted trees) and finds a minimal covering of the input control flow graphs with code segments. The segments are disjunct, i.e. no two segments have the same code in common. The program is minimal in the sense that the number of code segments is minimum under the property of disjunction for the given control flow specification. The procedure makes no assumption on the target processor architecture, and is meant to be used between task synthesis algorithms from a concurrent specification and a standard compiler for the target architecture. It is aimed at optimizing the size of very large, automatically generated flat code, and extends dramatically the scope of classical common sub-expression identification techniques. The potential effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through preliminary experiments.","1530-1591","0-7695-0993","10.1109/DATE.2001.915096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915096","","Productivity;Embedded system;Tree graphs;Automatic control;Hardware;Software performance;Software quality;Application software;Design methodology;Programming","data flow graphs;scheduling;software engineering;minimisation","minimal size code;schedule graphs;sequential programs;reactive systems;repeated code segments;directed rooted trees;input control flow graphs;code segments;disjunction;control flow specification;concurrent specification;standard compiler;target architectur;automatically generated flat code","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of the testbed is the verification (on the ground) of proposed operational battery management techniques on spacecraft. The testbed consists of a computer controlled system which has the capability to simulate power/orbit profiles with varying occultation periods and charge control methodologies (V/T levels, CC. etc.). Currently the testbed is deployed to simulate the NASA Modular Power System (MPS). This system consists of three NASA standard 50 Ah 22 cell nickel-cadmium batteries. Several orbital profiles have been implemented on the testbed. Since spacecraft telemetry channels are at a premium, battery data from spacecraft is usually very sparse. On the testbed, data on the performance of each of the cells within the batteries can be obtained, and hence a very accurate assessment of the battery performance is available. This data can subsequently be compared with telemetered data for analysis. A 'Taguchi' orthogonal array was utilized to determine the effect of five factors (at four levels) on battery characteristics. These factors are inrush-current, depth-of-discharge, temperature, orbit duration, and VT level. Sixteen independent experiments consisting of 60 orbits each were performed. Based on the results of this experiment, verification experiments were proposed. To date the verification experiments confirm the optimization of parameters yield better performance. Details of the experiment and recommendations based on the data are presented.","1089-3547","0-7803-3547","10.1109/IECEC.1996.552916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=552916","","NASA;Space vehicles;Power system simulation;System testing;Computational modeling;Application software;Battery management systems;Power system management;Control system synthesis;Computer simulation","space vehicle power plants;secondary cells;battery testers;test facilities;nickel;cadmium;automatic test equipment","NASA battery testbed;orbiting spacecraft;operational battery management techniques;computer controlled system;power/orbit profiles simulation;occultation periods;charge control methodologies;NASA Modular Power System;nickel-cadmium batteries;battery data;Taguchi orthogonal array;inrush-current;depth-of-discharge;orbit duration;VT level;Ni-Cd","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper aims at both the optimization of radiotherapy and the provision of insight into the biological mechanisms involved in tumor development. The basics of the modeling philosophy of Duechting (1968, 1981, 1992, 1995) have been adopted and substantially extended. The main processes taken into account by the model are the transitions between the cell cycle phases, the diffusion of oxygen and glucose, and the cell survival probabilities following irradiation. Specific algorithms satisfactorily describing tumor expansion and shrinkage have been applied, whereas a novel approach to the modeling of the tumor response to irradiation has been proposed and implemented. High-performance computing systems in conjunction with Web technologies have coped with the particularly high computer memory and processing demands. A visualization system based on the MATLAB software package and the virtual-reality modeling language has been employed. Its utilization has led to a spectacular representation of both the external surface and the internal structure of the developing tumor. The simulation model has been applied to the special case of small cell lung carcinoma in vitro irradiated according to both the standard and accelerated fractionation schemes. A good qualitative agreement with laboratory experience has been observed in all cases. Accordingly, the hypothesis that advanced simulation models for the in silico testing of tumor irradiation schemes could substantially enhance the radiotherapy optimization process is further strengthened. Currently, our group is investigating extensions of the presented algorithms so that efficient descriptions of the corresponding clinical (in vivo) cases are achieved.","1089-7771;1558-0032","","10.1109/4233.966103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966103","","Neoplasms;Visualization;Mathematical model;Biological system modeling;In vitro;Fractionation;Biology computing;Sugar;MATLAB;Software packages","tumours;virtual reality languages;data visualisation;radiation therapy;digital simulation;Monte Carlo methods;cellular transport;biodiffusion;Internet;medical computing;cancer;lung","3D Monte Carlo simulation model;in vitro tumor growth;modeling;irradiation response;high-performance computing;Web-based technologies;VRML visualization;biological mechanisms;cell cycle phases;oxygen diffusion;glucose diffusion;cell survival probabilities;tumor expansion;tumor shrinkage;MATLAB software package;external surface;internal structure;simulation model;small cell lung carcinoma;in silico testing;radiotherapy optimization","Carcinoma, Small Cell;Carcinoma, Small Cell;Cell Division;Computer Simulation;Humans;Internet;Lung Neoplasms;Lung Neoplasms;Models, Biological;Monte Carlo Method;Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Software Design;Spheroids, Cellular;Spheroids, Cellular","17","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Emerging Technologies for VLSI Systems","","2001","","","71","77","A method based on a modulo scheduling algorithm for software pipelining has been recently proposed to optimize clocked circuits. The resulting circuits are multi-phase clocked circuits, where all clocks have the same period. To preserve the functionality of the original circuit, registers must be placed after minimizing the clock period. The placement of these registers is derived from an arbitrary schedule determined during a clock period minimization step. A good schedule may allow one to decrease the number of registers and the number of phases needed in the final circuit. Decreasing the number of registers contributes to minimizing the area occupied by the circuit and reduces its power consumption; while decreasing the number of phases reduces the complexity of the clock generation and distribution task. In this paper, we propose polynomial-time-solvable methods to choose a good schedule once the clock period is minimized. The methods have been tested on a subject of the ISCAS89 benchmarks. Experimental results show that the number of registers which must be inserted in the final circuit, and the number of phases, have been significantly decreased compared to the case where an arbitrary schedule is chosen.","","0-7695-1056","10.1109/IWV.2001.923142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923142","","Registers;Circuits;Clocks;Scheduling algorithm;Pipeline processing;Optimization methods;Minimization;Energy consumption;Power generation;Polynomials","clocks;pipeline processing;scheduling;shift registers;sequential circuits;minimisation of switching nets;low-power electronics;circuit optimisation;logic CAD;graph theory","phase requirements;synchronous circuits;software pipelining techniques;modulo scheduling algorithm;multi-phase clocked circuits;arbitrary schedule;clock period minimization step;registers;power consumption;clock generation;polynomial-time-solvable methods;ISCAS89 benchmarks","","6","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we explore transport protocol optimizations for reducing the energy consumption of wireless LAN interfaces. Our work is based on the observation that, the transport protocol, which implements flow control to regulate the network traffic, plays a significant role in determining the workload of the network interface. Hence, by monitoring run-time parameters in the transport protocol, coarse-granularity idle periods, which present the best opportunities for network interface power reduction, can be accurately identified. We further show that, by tuning parameters in the protocol software implementation, we can shape the activity profile of the network interface, making it more energy efficient while remaining compliant to the TCP standard. We have performed extensive current measurements using an experimental testbed that consists of a Compaq iPAQ PDA with a Cisco Aironet wireless network adapter, to validate the proposed techniques. Our measurements indicate energy savings ranging from 28% to 69% compared to the use of state-of-the-art MAC layer power reduction techniques, with little or no impact on performance.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253690","","Transport protocols;Energy efficiency;Embedded system;Network interfaces;Energy consumption;Batteries;Wireless LAN;Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Runtime","transport protocols;embedded systems;network interfaces;wireless LAN","transport protocol optimization;energy efficient wireless embedded systems;network interface;wireless LAN interfaces;flow control;workload;run-time parameters;coarse-granularity idle periods;protocol software implementation;activity profile;current measurements;Compaq iPAQ PDA;Cisco Aironet wireless network adapter","","10","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the inherent geometric complexity and data size, this goal is often unachievable even with high performance graphics workstations, unless the original terrain height field mesh is simplified and approximated in order to reduce the number of geometric primitives that need to be rendered without compromising visual quality. This paper discusses the methodology and implementation aspects of our research work to improve the quality and speed of rendering general purpose desktop PCs by enhancing the geometrical and topological techniques for handing the very large terrain data sets. The proposed algorithm uses a compact and efficient multi-resolution grid representation and employs a variable screen-space threshold to bound the maximum error of the projected image. The appropriate level of detail is computed and generated dynamically in real-time, allowing for smooth changes of resolution across area of the surface. The method is different from the triangle-based LOD algorithms and is optimized for modern, low-end consumer 3D graphics cards and minimizes CPU usage during rendering. The software has been tested on real-world height maps as well as satellite phototextures of size up to 16K/spl middot/16K.The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm can dynamically generate view-dependent multi-resolution LOD terrain model and real-time rendering can be attained.","","0-7803-8909","10.1109/INDICO.2004.1497755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497755","","Digital elevation models;Rendering (computer graphics);Graphics;Multiresolution analysis;Data visualization;Workstations;Personal communication networks;Optimization methods;Software testing;Satellites","image resolution;image texture;image representation;real-time systems;mesh generation;data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics);terrain mapping","3D visualization;geographical dataset;geometrical-topological technique;digital terrain model;multiresolution grid representation;image projection;triangle-based LOD algorithm;optimization;graphics card;software testing;satellite phototexture;real-time rendering","","1","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The vertex /spl upsi/ is then said to cover itself and every other vertex in the ball with center /spl upsi/. Our formal problem statement is as follows: given an undirected graph G and an integer t/spl ges/1, find a (minimal) set C of vertices such that every vertex in G belongs to a unique set of balls of radius t centered at the vertices in C. The set of vertices thus obtained constitutes a code for vertex identification. We first develop topology-independent bounds on the size of C. We then develop methods for constructing C for several specific topologies such as binary cubes, nonbinary cubes, and trees. We also describe the identification of sets of vertices using covering codes that uniquely identify single vertices.

The 'determine where we want to be' is captured as trees of requirements and the 'what could get in the way' is captured as trees of potential failure modes. Scoring the impacts of these failure modes on the requirements results in a prioritized set of failure modes. The user then selects from a set of PACTs (Preventative measures, Analyses, process Controls and Tests) each of which has an effectiveness versus the various failure modes.

The design is based on a linear systolic dataflow algorithm, and control logic is added to reconfigure the resulting hardware. For the k-differences version of the approximate string matching problem, the proposed approach finds all approximate occurrences of a pattern in the reference string, with the time complexity O(n+m) where n and m are lengths of the reference string and the pattern, respectively.

Building on our previous success in developing optimization-based scheduling methods using Lagrangian relaxation for practical applications, this paper presents a novel Lagrangian relaxation neural network (LRNN) optimization technique. The convergence of LRNN for separable convex programming problems is established. For separable integer programming problems, LRNN is constructed to obtain near optimal solution in an efficient manner. When applying LRNN to separable job shop scheduling, a new neural dynamic programming method is developed to solve subproblems making innovative use of the dynamic programming structure. The synergy of Lagrangian relaxation and neural dynamic programming leads to a powerful neural optimization method for job shop scheduling. Testing results obtained by software simulation demonstrate that the performance is superior to what has been reported in the neural network literature. Results are also very close to what were obtained by a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm, and should be much improved when the method is refined and implemented in hardware.","1050-4729","0-7803-4300","10.1109/ROBOT.1998.677428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=677428","","Lagrangian functions;Neural networks;Job shop scheduling;Optimization methods;Dynamic programming;Manufacturing;Buildings;Linear programming;Software testing;Software performance","integer programming;convex programming;convergence;production control;neural nets","Lagrangian relaxation neural networks;job shop scheduling;optimization-based scheduling methods;separable convex programming problems;separable integer programming problems;neural dynamic programming method","","2","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such prediction allows us to assess the feasibility of creating the probe volume and collecting the scattered light, and can help choose the orientation of the lines of sight and the window locations. Due to reflections from the blade surfaces, there are usually regions where measurement is impossible. The analysis of these zero data zones is presented and leads to an optimized blade pitch partition for decreasing the acquisition time and better defining the azimuthal location of the acquired data.

However, most previous research on pointer analysis mostly focuses on pointers pointing to global or local variables. In this paper, we study points-to analysis of heap-oriented pointers using profiling information. An instrumentation tool and a set of library routines are developed to measure points-to sets of memory references at run time. Different naming methods for heap-oriented pointers are studied. We found that it is very important to adopt appropriate naming methods to recognize wrapper functions for memory allocation and memory management functions defined by users. Based on these naming methods, the approaches in pointer analysis, such as flow sensitivity and context sensitivity, are examined with the run-time tool. The program characteristics are observed at run time to evaluate what kind of compiler analysis is needed. Experiments are conducted on SPEC CPU2000 integer benchmarks.

To solve this problem, global optimization criteria are decomposed into local optimization criteria that are used to govern node activation updating in the connectionist model. Nodes representing disorders compete with each other to account for each 'individual' present manifestation, yet complement each other to account for all present manifestation, yet complement each other to account for all present manifestations through parallel node interactions. When equilibrium is reached, the network settles into a locally optimal state in which some disorder nodes (winners) are fully activated and compose the diagnosis for the given case, while all other disorder nodes are fully deactivated. A resettling process is proposed to improve accuracy. Three randomly generated examples of diagnostic problems, each of which has 1024 cases, were tested.<<ETX>>","0018-9472;2168-2909","","10.1109/21.31034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=31034","","Problem-solving;Artificial intelligence;Testing;NASA;Information systems;Computer science;Nervous system;Polynomials;Computer networks;Concurrent computing","artificial intelligence;optimisation;problem solving","probabilistic causal model;artificial intelligence;connectionist model;diagnostic problem solving;global optimization;local optimization;parallel node interactions","","76","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Testability and availability of connections for burn-in before mounting are provided by the use of 50-mil-pitch test pads interconnected to the leads. The preferred solution for external connection and test pads is provided by the use of a TAB (tab automated bonding) lead frame bonded to the ceramic package.

Present system design principles do not articulate a philosophy nor a body of practice about placing man in the system at the system architecture level. Since these functions do not appear in the top level architecture, they do not appear at the intermediate and lower levels of the design specifications. Having not been defined in the specifications, human decision making and control performance are generally not tested during the subsequent test and verification cycles. Decision making is no longer a uniquely human function in complex systems. Indeed, the speed and complexity of many system processes often preclude the human from decision and control functions.

On the SPEC95 benchmarks, path profiling overhead averaged 31%, as compared to 16% for efficient edge profiling.

Recently it has been shown that the modelling of the boundary conditions, also known as the process initial conditions, is a crucial feature in the analysis and control of these processes. This paper presents some further results on the effects of so-called 'dynamic' process initial conditions on the controllability and stability properties of discrete linear repetitive processes. Previous work has shown that these dynamic process initial conditions alone can destroy the stability properties of these processes. Hence their effects must be 'adequately' accounted for the process modelling stage in order to ensure that subsequent analysis does not lead to incorrect results/conclusions.

The approach is based on some novel applications and extensions of constraint database techniques. We assume the existence of a global database schema. The contents of each data source are described using a set of constraint tuples over the global schema; each such tuple indicates possible contributions from the source. The ""source description catalog"" (SDC) of a global relation consists of its associated constraint tuples. Such a method of description is advantageous since it is flexible to add new sources and to modify existing ones. In our framework, to evaluate a conjunctive query over the global schema, a plan generator first identifies relevant data sources by ""evaluating"" the query against the SDCs using techniques of constraint query evaluation; it then formulates an evaluation plan, consisting of some specialized queries over different paths. The evaluation of a query associated with a path is done by a sequence of partial evaluations at data sources along the path, similar to sideways information passing of Datalog; the partially evaluated queries travel along their associated paths. Our SDC based query planning is efficient since it avoids the NP-complete query rewriting process. We can achieve further optimization using techniques such as emptiness test.","1063-6382","0-7695-0071","10.1109/ICDE.1999.754953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=754953","","Databases;Computer science;Query processing;Warehousing;Data warehouses;Data engineering;Application software;Process planning;Testing;Software libraries","query processing;deductive databases;constraint handling","constraint databases;data integration approach;autonomous source databases;global database schema;data source;constraint tuples;global schema;source description catalog;global relation;conjunctive query;plan generator;data sources;constraint query evaluation;evaluation plan;specialized queries;partial evaluations;sideways information passing;Datalog;partially evaluated queries;SDC based query planning;NP-complete query rewriting process;emptiness test","","","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

'Manufacturing Technologies - Present and Future'","","1995","","","133","140","The thermo-mechanical integrity of an electronics assembly is strongly affected by the attachment method used between functional components and the printed wiring board. The use of solder as an interconnect medium is the most common method in use today. In most applications, solder is required to serve multiple functions including electrical, thermal, and structural connection. Repetitive loads caused by thermal cycling and vibrations result in cyclical thermo-mechanical stresses that often lead to pre-mature fatigue cracking in the solder. Continued exposure to these environments leads to degradation or failure of the solder thereby reducing the hardware's useful life. This paper presents a novel method for predicting the fatigue life of an electronics assembly by analyzing every interconnect using an automated process modeling approach. Modular fatigue based routines, incorporated through a user friendly software tool known as FSAP (Fatigue Synthesis for Avionics Programs), facilitate concurrent design development and optimization relative to the hardware's thermo-mechanical fatigue response. FSAP integrates the global effects from specific usage environments with the detailed design and process features associated with the electronics assembly. An application of FSAP along with comprehensive model validation results from accelerated fatigue life testing is presented for a variety of common interconnect configurations including leaded and non-leaded surface mount components and hybrid/MCM packages.","","0-7803-2996","10.1109/IEMT.1995.526105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=526105","","Fatigue;Aerospace electronics;Thermomechanical processes;Assembly;Lead;Thermal stresses;Hardware;Wiring;Thermal loading;Thermal degradation","production testing;fatigue;printed circuit testing;soldering;cracks;integrated circuit interconnections;concurrent engineering;life testing;fatigue testing;avionics","product integrity assessment;fatigue synthesis;avionics programs;thermo-mechanical integrity;electronics assembly;attachment method;functional components;printed wiring board;pre-mature fatigue cracking;automated process modeling approach;FSAP;concurrent design development;specific usage environments;model validation results;accelerated fatigue life testing;interconnect configurations;surface mount components;solder interconnect medium","","2","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No markers or sensors are attached to the subject. Given a video clip, the first step is to fit the 3D human model manually to the subject in the first frame of the video. Then background subtraction is used to extract the human silhouette. We propose the silhouette chamfer as the main matching feature. A chamfer distance measure is carried out on the extracted subject silhouette. The silhouette chamfer contains both the chamfer distance and region information. Finally, we use a discrete Kalman filter to predict the pose of the subject in each image frame. The updating step uses Broydent's method to optimize the predicted pose to fit the person's silhouette by using the cost function. We use the gait database SOTON to test our system. The image sequences contain human walking in both indoor and outdoor environments.

In addition, more electronic devices am being used under the hood of automobiles, where high temperature is also a problem. This paper describes several methods for placing chips on a substrate to optimize the temperature. The thermal properties of a few test circuits were simulated usinig commercially available and custom software. The test circuits were then fabricated, and a commercially available system was used to measure the temperature at 10 points of the substrate and calculate the junction temperature. A large discrepancy was found between the simulated and the measured results. This shows that the two-dimensional thermal simulation packages for electronics cirsuits are insufficient and should be improved to take the third dimension into consideration. However the two-dimensional programs did show general trends.

The results of the empirical study showed that few classes were found suitable for inlining and that the declassification was not overly successful when optimizing the test programs. One of the advantages of declassification is that it does not result in code bloating.

Uncertainty can arise at two levels: multiple and single tasks. When a mobile user changes environments, the context changes resulting in the possibility of the user requesting tasks which are specific for the new environment. However as the user moves these requested tasks may no longer be context relevant. Additionally, the runtime of each task is often highly dependent on the input data. We introduce an hierarchical multi-resolution statistical task model that captures relevant aspects at the task and intertask levels, and captures not only uncertainty, but also introduces the notion of utility for the user. We have developed a system of nonparametric statistical techniques for modeling the runtime of a specific task. This model is a framework where we define problems of design and optimization of statistical soft real-time systems (SSRTS).

Computational efficiency of the density construction is ensured using an orthogonal forward regression, and the algorithm incrementally minimizes the leave-one-out test score. A local regularization method is incorporated naturally into the density construction process to further enforce sparsity. An additional advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is fully automatic and the user is not required to specify any criterion to terminate the density construction procedure. This is in contrast to an existing state-of-art kernel density estimation method using the support vector machine (SVM), where the user is required to specify some critical algorithm parameter. Several examples are included to demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to effectively construct a very sparse kernel density estimate with comparable accuracy to that of the full sample optimized Parzen window density estimate.

However, before autonomy can be routinely utilized, we must provide techniques for providing assurance that the system will perform correctly in flight. We describe why autonomous systems require advanced verification techniques, and offer some management and technical techniques for addressing the differences. Autonomous goal-driven spacecraft require advances in verification techniques because optimization (e.g. planning and scheduling) algorithms are at the core of much of autonomy. It is the nature of such algorithms that over much of the input space an intuitively ""small"" change in the input results in a correspondingly ""small"" change in the output: This type of response typically leads one to conclude, quite reasonably, that if the two responses are correct, those responses ""between"" them will probably be correct. However, there are certain regions in the input space where a ""small"" change in the input will result in a radically different output: One is not so inclined to conclude that all responses in these transition zones are likely to be correct. We believe, for two reasons, that these transition zones are one place where autonomous systems are likely to fail. First, boundary conditions, often a rich source of faults, are highly exercised in the transition zones, and so increase the likelihood of faults. Second, within the transition zone the algorithm outputs are likely to appear unusual, and, since the outputs of the algorithm become inputs to the remainder of the system, the whole system is probably pushed outside of its nominal usage profile: historically shown to be another good source of faults. We close with a discussion of risk management. Autonomous systems have many well-known management risk factors.

One is the choice of a unique modeling language that spans all the needed abstraction levels for hardware system design, from functional verification down to system implementation. The second is the possibility to allow fast system design analysis and exploration avoiding to recompile the model every time the design is changed, by dynamic loading parameters from XML files. Finally we want to support automatic generation of the hardware model from which the final system logic synthesis can be performed.","","0-7803-8689","10.1109/ISSPIT.2004.1433695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433695","","Digital signal processing;Mathematical model;Hardware design languages;Computational modeling;Computer languages;System testing;Writing;Design methodology;Logic design;Automatic logic units","simulation languages;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;XML;optimisation;signal processing","unified System C;complex system synthesis;DSP algorithm;fast design-to-synthesis flow;hardware description language;HDL implementation;logic synthesis;modeling language;hardware system design;functional verification;dynamic loading parameter;XML file","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This guarantees that their composition will be a valid algebraic opening or closing. The power, but also the difficulty, in applying these fuzzy operators to image analysis is the large variety of fuzzy norms and the absence of systematic ways in selecting them. Towards this goal, we have performed extensive experiments in applying these fuzzy operators to various nonlinear filtering and image analysis tasks, attempting first to understand the effect that the type of fuzzy norm and the shape/size of the structuring function has on the resulting new image operators.

However, in wireless mobile devices like palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDA), storage memory is limited or absent due to weight, size and power constraints. As a consequence, swapping over remote memory devices can be considered as a viable alternative. Nevertheless, power hungry wireless network interface cards (WNIC) may limit the battery lifetime and application performance if not efficiently exploited. In this work we explore performance and energy of network swapping in comparison with swapping on local micro-drives and flash memories. Our study points out that remote swapping over power-manageable WNICs can be more efficient than local swapping and that both energy and performance can be optimized through power-aware reshaping of data requests.

Specifically, the bilevel model allows one to define different objective functions for the terrorist and the system operator as well as permitting the imposition of constraints on the outer optimization that are functions of both the inner and outer variables. This degree of flexibility is not possible through existing max-min models. The bilevel formulation is investigated through a problem in which the goal of the destructive agent is to minimize the number of power system components that must be destroyed in order to cause a loss of load greater than or equal to a specified level. This goal is tempered by the logical assumption that, following a deliberate outage, the system operator will implement all feasible corrective actions to minimize the level of system load shed. The resulting nonlinear mixed-integer bilevel programming formulation is transformed into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear program by replacing the inner optimization by its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and converting a number of nonlinearities to linear equivalents using some well-known integer algebra results. The equivalent formulation has been tested on two case studies, including the 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System, through the use of commercially available software.","0885-8950;1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2005.846198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425574","Bilevel programming;deliberate outages;load shedding;mixed-integer linear programming (MILP);power system security and vulnerability;terrorist threat","Lagrangian functions;Upper bound;Power system modeling;Integer linear programming;Software testing;System testing;Linear programming;Power transmission lines;Load flow;Power generation","minimisation;power system reliability;power system security;load shedding;integer programming;terrorism","terrorist threat problem;optimization;max-min models;power system components;mixed-integer bilevel programming formulation;linear equivalents;integer algebra;IEEE reliability test system;load shedding;power system security","","99","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we analyze the process of underwriting Insurance applications, which is the classification problem used to illustrate the life cycle of a classifier. After discussing some design tradeoffs that must be addressed for the on-line and off-line use of a classifier, we describe the design and implementation of a fuzzy rule-based (FRB) and a fuzzy case-based (FCB) classifier. We establish a standard reference dataset (SRD), consisting of 3,000 insurance applications with their corresponding decisions. The SRD exemplifies the results achieved by an ideal, optimal classifier, and represents the target for our design. We apply evolutionary algorithms to perform an off-line optimization of the design parameters of each classifier, modifying their behavior to approximate this target. The SRD is also used as a reference for testing and performing a five-fold cross-validation of the classifiers. Finally, we focus on the monitoring and maintenance of the FRB classifier. We describe a fusion architecture that supports an off-line quality assurance process of the on-line FRB classifier. The fusion module takes the outputs of multiple classifiers, determines their degree of consensus, and compares their overall agreement with that of the FRB classifier. From this analysis, we can identify the most suitable cases to update the SRD, to audit, or to be reviewed by senior underwriters.","","0-7803-7918","10.1109/NAFIPS.2003.1226834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226834","","Insurance;Production;Monitoring;Costs;Software maintenance;Design optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing;Performance evaluation;Quality assurance","evolutionary computation;fuzzy logic;optimisation;knowledge based systems;insurance;life cycle costing","fuzzy knowledge based classifier;underwriting insurance application;fuzzy rule based classifier;fuzzy case based classifier;standard reference dataset;optimal classifier;evolutionary algorithms;offline optimization;design parameters;five fold cross validation;fusion architecture;offline quality assurance;online classifier;multiple classifiers","","5","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is thus important to identify when a particular static call chain for an object-oriented program may not be executable, or feasible, such that there is no input for which the chain will be taken. The paper examines type infeasibility of call chains, which is the infeasibility caused by inherently polymorphic call sites and sometimes also due to imprecision in call graphs. The problem of determining whether a call chain is type infeasible is defined and exemplified, a key property characterizing type in infeasible call chains is described, empirical results from examining the call graphs for a set of Java programs are described, and two approaches to automatically deciding the type infeasibility of a call chain due to object parameters are presented.","","0-7695-1387","10.1109/SCAM.2001.972681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972681","","Information analysis;Application software;Runtime;Performance analysis;Java;Software engineering;Computer applications;Debugging;Software testing;Optimizing compilers","program diagnostics;graph theory;object-oriented programming;type theory;Java","type infeasible call chains;software engineering applications;static analysis;program call graph;static call chain;object-oriented program;inherently polymorphic call sites;call graph imprecision;Java programs;object parameters","","1","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to compare such decision aids independently, a systematic process was conceived, designed, constructed, tested and implemented. The purpose was to use automation to standardize a decision process among diverse adversaries in a dynamic, complex, technological environment. The process first step structured the factors needed to arrive at an equitable decision on technology transfer from domestic to foreign ownership, control, or influence. The factors were identified by participants in the decentralized decision process. Using group problem solving techniques, the most important factors were identified and ranked. Factor weights were determined with automated aids. Four decision processes were evaluated to determine their accuracy in arriving at a decision dealing with proposed technology transfers. The author deals with the process of identifying the factors and testing the decision aids.<<ETX>>","","0-85296-541","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=140394","","Decision support systems;Government data processing;Software testing;Technology transfer","decision support systems;government data processing;program testing;software selection;technology transfer","technology transfers;decision aid systems;decision making;competing products;systematic process;decision process;diverse adversaries;technological environment;equitable decision;foreign ownership;decentralized decision process;group problem solving techniques;automated aids","","1","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this paper, we demonstrate that subthreshold-voltage circuit design (400 mV and below) lends itself well to the performance and energy demands of sensor network processors. Moreover, we show that the landscape for microarchitectural energy optimization dramatically changes in the subthreshold domain. The dominance of leakage power in the subthreshold regime demands architectures that i) reduce overall area; ii) increase the utility of transistors; while iii) maintaining acceptable CPI efficiency. We confirm these observations by performing SPICE-level analysis of 21 sensor network processors and memory architectures. Our best sensor platform, implemented in 130nm CMOS and operating at 235 mV, only consumes 1.38 pJ/instruction, nearly an order of magnitude less energy than previously published sensor network processor results.

Hardware voters are bit voters that compute a majority of n input bits. An m-out-of-n hardware bit voter is a circuit with n bit inputs, and 1 bit output y, such that y=1 if at least m-out-of-n input bits have the value 1. A hardware voter can be implemented with logic gates in CMOS VLSI technology. Designers are looking for optimal designs with respect to the following criteria: circuit complexity, number of logic levels, fan-in and fan-out, power dissipation, testability, or any combinations of the previous requirements in order to obtain high reliability for the voting circuits. A detailed reliability analysis, failure modes and effects analysis of voters at the transistor level, is performed using CARE tools. CARE (computer aided reliability engineering) is a powerful software tool that can be used concurrently in the phases of R&D for complex reliability analysis of electronic circuits. The main goal of these analyses is to identify the best designs of voting circuits, in terms of reliability parameters and to identify the possible technological failures that can affect them.","","0-7803-6654","10.1109/EMAP.2000.904192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904192","","Failure analysis;Voting;Hardware;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Logic testing;Circuit testing;Performance analysis;Fault tolerance;Redundancy","failure analysis;majority logic;logic design;redundancy;circuit complexity;VLSI;CMOS logic circuits;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit design;design for testability;computer aided engineering;circuit CAD;integrated circuit reliability","reliability;failure analysis;voting circuits;hardware redundant design;fault-tolerant design;hardware redundancy;N-modular redundant design;hardware voters;bit voters;input bit majority;m-out-of-n hardware bit voter;hardware voter;logic gates;CMOS VLSI technology;optimal design;circuit complexity;logic levels;fan-in;fan-out;power dissipation;testability;reliability analysis;failure modes/effects analysis;transistor level FMEA;CARE tools;computer aided reliability engineering;software tool;electronic circuits;voting circuit design;reliability parameters;technological failures","","23","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since building sophisticated single processor based systems is a complex process from design, verification, and software development perspectives, the use of chip multiprocessing is inevitable in future microprocessors. In fact, the abundance of explicit loop-level parallelism in many embedded applications helps us identify chip multiprocessing as one of the most promising directions in designing systems for embedded applications. Another architectural trend that we observe in embedded systems, namely, multi-voltage processors, is driven by the need of reducing energy consumption during program execution. Practical implementations such as Transmeta's Crusoe and Intel's XScale tune processor voltage/frequency depending on current execution load. Considering these two trends, chip multiprocessing and voltage/frequency scaling, this paper presents an optimization strategy for an architecture that makes use of both chip parallelism and voltage scaling. In our proposal, the compiler takes advantage of heterogeneity in parallel execution between the loads of different processors and assigns different voltages/frequencies to different processors if doing so reduces energy consumption without increasing overall execution cycles significantly. Our experiments with a set of applications show that this optimization can bring large energy benefits without much performance loss.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269048","","Energy consumption;Voltage;Frequency;Application software;Transistors;Buildings;Software design;Process design;Programming;Microprocessors","multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;microprocessor chips;parallelising compilers;power consumption;embedded systems","processor workload heterogeneity;energy consumption reduction;chip multiprocessors;semiconductor technology;single processor based systems;loop level parallelism;embedded systems;multivoltage processors;Transmetas Crusoe;Intels XScale tune processor;voltage/frequency scaling;optimization strategy;compiler support;chip parallelism;parallel execution","","21","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm first locates several feature points on the background skeleton of the digit image. Possible segmentation paths are then constructed by matching these feature points. With geometric property measures, these segmentation paths are ranked using fuzzy rules generated from a decision-tree approach. Finally, the top ranked segmentation paths are tested one by one by an optimized nearest neighbor classifier until one of these candidates is accepted based on an acceptance criterion.

The estimation process is done by using power macro-models, thus making analogue measurement equipment obsolete to the software engineer once the SOC design is characterized. Compared to sampling-based profiling systems, the performance overhead of energy profiling is less, because the energy estimation is done completely parallel to the functional units residing on the SOC. The proposed methodology can be used for run-time power optimization and in-system energy profiling.

Its efficiency depends on the characteristics of the granular mixtures to be sorted, the feed rate, the configuration of the electrode system, the applied high-voltage, the environmental conditions, and so on. The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the usefulness of computer-assisted experimental design in the optimization of such a process. The example analyzed in the paper was suggested by a typical application of electrostatic separation technique in the recycling industry: the selective sorting of metals and insulating materials from chopped wire and cable waste. The objective was to maximize the benefits from the recycling of both constituents of a binary copper-PVC granular mixture. A preliminary set of electrostatic separation tests, performed on a custom-designed laboratory unit, guided the choice of the starting values of the parameters considered in the computer-assisted experimental procedure of process optimization. The results of a first experiment, carried out in conformity with a fractional factorial scheme, were used for the computation of the coefficients of a linear mathematical model of the electrostatic process. The model was then employed to predict the values of the operating variables for which the optimum of the process is attained. A second experiment was performed in order to confirm the accuracy of the prediction. The procedure presented in this paper and the accompanying computer programs can be easily adapted to other electrostatic process applications.","0197-2618","0-7803-6401","10.1109/IAS.2000.881189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881189","","Design for experiments;Design optimization;Application software;Recycling;Electrostatic processes;Feeds;Electrodes;Electrostatic analysis;Metals industry;Sorting","electrostatics;separation;design of experiments;recycling;electrodes;electrical engineering computing","computer-assisted experimental design;electrostatic separation processes;multi-factorial process;granular mixtures;feed rate;electrode system;high-voltage;environmental conditions;process optimization;electrostatic separation;recycling industry;selective sorting;insulating materials;chopped wire waste;chopped cable waste;binary copper-PVC granular mixture;linear mathematical model","","","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach flexibly adapts to changing production conditions and is suitable for high volume production. In this approach, workpiece agents auction off their current task, while machine agents bid for tasks. When awarding a machine, a workpiece agent takes into account not only the machine's current workload, but also the workpieces leaving the machine. If a machine's outgoing stream is blocked, the machine agent eventually ceases to accept new workpieces, thus blocking its input stream as well. As a result, a capacity bottleneck is automatically propagated in the opposite direction of the material flow. A unique feature of this mechanism is that it does not pre-suppose any specific material flow; the current capacity bottleneck is always propagated in the opposite direction of the actual flow, no matter how this flow looks like. Daimler Chrysler has evaluated the new control approach as a bypass to an existing manufacturing line. A suite of performance tests demonstrated the industrial feasibility and benefits of the approach.","","0-7803-7241","10.1109/ETFA.2001.997722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997722","","Control systems;Production systems;Manufacturing industries;Manufacturing processes;Software agents;Testing;Investments;Costs;Robustness;Optimized production technology","flexible manufacturing systems;manufacturing data processing;software agents;computer aided production planning","flexible production systems;workpiece agents;machine agents;machine workload;capacity bottleneck;material flow;product-life cycles;software agent","","46","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A general formulation of the network reconfiguration for loss minimization is given for optimization of distribution loss reduction and a solution approach is presented. The solution algorithm for loss minimization has been developed based on a two-stage solution methodology. The first stage of this solution algorithm finds a loop, which gives the maximum loss reduction in the network. For this purpose a simple-to-use formula, called loop loss reduction formula has been developed. To find a branch exchange, which results in the maximum loss reduction in the loop, the second stage applies a proposed technique called distance-center technique. Therefore, the solution algorithm of the proposed method can identify the most effective branch exchange operations for loss reduction, with minimum computational efforts. The software for proposed solution algorithm is capable of performing optimum reconfiguration for a radial distribution network for any number of buses and laterals. The proposed feeder reconfiguration is tested with 33-bus IEEE test system and the results are compared with Baran and Wu's method.","","0-7803-8724","10.1109/PECON.2004.1461651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461651","","Intelligent networks;Voltage;Minimization methods;Load flow;System testing;Niobium;Equations;Software performance;Software algorithms;Impedance","distribution networks;losses;minimisation;load flow","network reconfiguration;loss reduction;load flow method;radial distribution networks;simple algebraic expression;optimization;loss minimization;two-stage solution methodology;loop loss reduction formula;distance-center technique;33-bus IEEE test system","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on enhancement of speech signals, assumed to be degraded by additive white noise. Speech enhancement is performed in the time-domain, by means of a low-order singular value decomposition that allows removal of the noise contribution while preserving the harmonic structure of the original speech signal. The approach was tested on synthetic data and applied to real data, concerning hoarse voices of cordectomised patients. Its simple structure allows a real-time implementation, based on C and assembler code, properly optimised on a DSP board. Hence, the method is suitable for portable device realisation, as an aid to disphonic speakers. It could be of help for diminishing the effort in speaking, which is closely related to social problems due to the awkwardness of voice.","","0-7803-7503","10.1109/ICDSP.2002.1028225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028225","","Noise reduction;Speech enhancement;Pathology;Degradation;Additive white noise;Time domain analysis;Singular value decomposition;Testing;Assembly;Digital signal processing","singular value decomposition;real-time systems;speech enhancement;handicapped aids;C language;digital signal processing chips;white noise;software tools;program assemblers","SVD-based portable device;real-time hoarse voice denoising;pathological voices;hoarseness;airflow turbulence;vocal tract;noise;speech signals;speech enhancement;additive white noise;low-order singular value decomposition;speech signal harmonic structure;synthetic data;real data;cordectomised patients;real-time implementation;C code;assembler code;DSP board;disphonic speakers;dysphonia;software development tool","","2","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rosen","IBM Cambridge Scientific Center; NA","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","1981","SE-7","1","60","78","It is known that not aU paths are possible in the run time control flow of many programs. It is also known that data flow analysis cannot restrict attention to exactly those paths that are possible. It is, therefore, usual for analytic methods to consider aU paths. Sharper information can be obtained by considering a recursive set of paths that is large enough to include aUl possible paths, but smaU enough to exclude many of the impossible ones. This paper presents a simple uniform methodology for sharpening data flow information by considering certain recursive path sets of practical importance. Associated with each control flow arc there is a relation on a finite set Q. The paths that qualify to be considered are (essentially) those for which the composition of the relations encountered is nonempty. For example, Q might be the set of all assignments of values to each of several bit variables used by a program to remember some facts about the past and branch accordingly in the future. Given any data-flow problem together with qualifying relations on Q associated with the control flow arcs, we construct a new problem. Considering all paths in the new problem is equivalent to considering only qualifying paths in the old one. Preliminary experiments (with a smaUl set of real programs) indicate that qualified analysis is feasible and substantialy more informative than ordinary analysis.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.1981.234509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1702803","Data flow analysis;global variable;interprocedural analysis;label variable;symbolic execution","Testing;Data analysis;Computer languages;Feedback;Assembly;Flowcharts;Constraint optimization;Operating systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Availability","","Data flow analysis;global variable;interprocedural analysis;label variable;symbolic execution","","10","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Three key parameters were selected for initial analysis: the force exerted by the bonding stylus; the laser power; and the on-time of the laser. Using a Box-Behnken statistical design for the experiment, an efficient set of tests was derived. Four sets of experimental samples were fabricated, to be used for the as-fabricated testing, high-temperature aging, and thermal cycling. Only the as-fabricated results are reported here. Using a design-of-experiments software package for the PC, a quadratic equation was derived from the data explicitly defining the relationships among the three parameters and relating them to bond strength. Using the techniques of surface response methodology, a response surface was created, showing the optimum operating region for the ILB process based on the parameter range chosen. The initial screening experiments show that good bond strength occurs in a range of constant energy (power times on-time) for the CW laser bonder; in the range of the three parameters tested, bond strength was optimized at forces of 20 grams, a power of 4.3 W, and laser on-time of 150 ms.<<ETX>>","","0-7803-0155","10.1109/IEMT.1991.279738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=279738","","Bonding;Power lasers;Response surface methodology;Optical design;Equations;Calibration;Laser stability;Application software;Circuit testing;Sun","laser beam applications;tape automated bonding","process window;TAB;process characterization;laser bonding;screening experiments;inner-lead bonding;ILB;force;bonding stylus;laser power;on-time;Box-Behnken statistical design;set of tests;experimental samples;as-fabricated testing;high-temperature aging;thermal cycling;design-of-experiments software package;quadratic equation;bond strength;surface response methodology;response surface;optimum operating region;CW laser bonder;4.3 W;150 ms","","","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual prototyping software is essentially multi body simulation software that requires the availability of models of all the vehicle components. The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modelling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior. In this paper, a grey-box model of a racing motorcycle mono tube shock absorber is proposed. It consists of a nonlinear parametric model and a black-box, neural network based model. The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and it has been validated against experimental test data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the real behavior of the shock absorber with an accuracy that matches or even beats that of other models previously presented in the literature.

In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods, which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods, depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.","0840-7789","0-7803-3716","10.1109/CCECE.1997.614847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=614847","","Pricing;Cost function;Load flow;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Fuel economy;Power system modeling;Production;Load management;Consumer behavior","economics;transmission network calculations;tariffs;power system analysis computing;load flow;optimisation;software packages","optimal electricity pricing method;transmission system considerations;real-time electricity rate structures;pricing algorithm;operating costs;time-of-use pricing;transmission costs;economic benefit;IEEE-test systems;MINOS package;modified optimal power flow problem;electricity supply pricing;computer simulation","","2","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing methods that assign orthologs based on the similarity between DNA or protein sequences may make erroneous assignments when sequence similarity does not clearly delineate the evolutionary relationship among genes of the same families. In this paper, we present a new approach to ortholog assignment that takes into account both sequence similarity and evolutionary events at a genome level, where orthologous genes are assumed to correspond to each other in the most parsimonious evolving scenario under genome rearrangement. First, the problem is formulated as that of computing the signed reversal distance with duplicates between the two genomes of interest. Then, the problem is decomposed into two new optimization problems, called minimum common partition and maximum cycle decomposition, for which efficient heuristic algorithms are given. Following this approach, we have implemented a high-throughput system for assigning orthologs on a genome scale, called SOAR, and tested it on both simulated data and real genome sequence data. Compared to a recent ortholog assignment method based entirely on homology search (called INPARANOID), SOAR shows a marginally better performance in terms of sensitivity on the real data set because it is able to identify several correct orthologous pairs that are missed by INPARANOID. The simulation results demonstrate that SOAR, in general, performs better than the iterated exemplar algorithm in terms of computing the reversal distance and assigning correct orthologs.","1545-5963;1557-9964;2374-0043","","10.1109/TCBB.2005.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541983","Ortholog;paralog;gene duplication;genome rearrangement;reversal;comparative genomics.","Genomics;Bioinformatics;Sequences;Genetic mutations;DNA;Proteins;Heuristic algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;System testing;Computational modeling","genetics;DNA;proteins;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;optimisation;biology computing","orthologous genes;genome rearrangement;comparative genomics;DNA sequences;protein sequences;sequence similarity;evolutionary events;optimization;minimum common partition;maximum cycle decomposition;efficient heuristic algorithms;SOAR;signed reversal distance","Algorithms;Animals;Chromosomes, Human, X;Computational Biology;Databases, Genetic;Evolution, Molecular;Gene Rearrangement;Genome;Genomics;Humans;Mice;Rats;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Software;X Chromosome","60","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, if the data set is supervised, in the sense that we know the corresponding latent vector value for each feature vector; it is more sensible to use same regression method for finding the mapping in advance. The mapping is then fixed during optimization of the log likelihood of the data set. It is concluded that in terms of log likelihood the methods are comparable.

For a yield management group, it is essential to capture defects of interest and to eliminate defects that do not impact yield. In a foundry where multiple devices are manufactured, it is crucial to have an inspection strategy that is transferable to many devices. Such a strategy also needs to be effective in capturing the same defect types by process layer. This paper discusses the challenges involved in creating such a strategy and steps taken to successfully combat it through a collaboration between Chartered Silicon Partnership (CSP) and KLA-Tencor (K-T). A KLA-Tencor 2139 brightfield inspection tool was used for defect image capture. Segmented Auto Threshold (SAT), a tool available on the 2139, is used to eliminate nuisance defects during inspection. SAT is a powerful tool, but the inspection recipes can be complex. Another tool on the 2139, AutoSAT, may be used to facilitate creation of such sophisticated inspections. AutoSAT samples defects on the wafer and prompts the user to classify them as real, killer or nuisance. Once this is done, AutoSAT uses a predefined SAT template set to optimize the thresholds to suppress nuisance and enhance critical defect capture. This approach is particularly useful in a foundry environment where the yield management group is faced with a variety of devices, requiring many inspections.","1078-8743","0-7803-6555","10.1109/ASMC.2001.925638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=925638","","Foundries;Inspection;Etching;Silicon;Optical scattering;Pixel;Semiconductor device noise;Manufacturing;Collaboration;Delay","inspection;integrated circuit yield;integrated circuit testing;production testing;fault location;software tools;production engineering computing","customized AutoSAT templates;foundry environment;recipe set-up;defect detection;defect analysis;yield management;defect capture;defect elimination;defect yield impact;multiple device manufacture;transferable inspection strategy;defect types;process layer;brightfield inspection tool;defect image capture;Segmented Auto Threshold tool;SAT tool;nuisance defects;inspection;inspection recipe complexity;AutoSAT;AutoSAT defect sampling;defect classification;real defects;killer defects;critical defect capture","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reject option is based on an estimate of the classification reliability, measured by a reliability evaluator /spl Psi/. Trivially, once a reject threshold /spl sigma/ has been fixed, a sample is rejected if the corresponding value of /spl Psi/ is below /spl sigma/. Obviously, as /spl sigma/ represents the least tolerable classification reliability level, when its value varies the reject option becomes more or less severe. In order to adapt the behavior of the reject option to the requirements of the considered application domain, a function P characterizing the reject option's adequacy to the domain has been introduced. It is shown that P can be expressed as a function of /spl sigma/ and, consequently, the optimal value for /spl sigma/ is defined as the one which maximizes the function P. The method for determining the optimal threshold value is independent of the specific 0-reject classifier, while the definition of the reliability evaluators is related to the classifier's architecture. General criteria for defining appropriate reliability evaluators within a classification paradigm are illustrated in the paper and are based on the localization, in the feature space, of the samples that could be classified with a low reliability. The definition of the reliability evaluators for three popular architectures of neural networks (backpropagation, learning vector quantization and probabilistic network) is presented.

In order to regain the tactile and kinesthetic information that is lost, a computerized force feedback endoscopic surgical grasper (FREG) was developed with computer control and a haptic user interface. The system uses standard unmodified grasper shafts and tips. The FREG can control grasping forces either by surgeon teleoperation control, or under software control. The FREG performance was evaluated using an automated palpation function (programmed series of compressions) in which the grasper measures mechanical properties of the grasped materials. The material parameters obtained from measurements showed the ability of the FREG to discriminate between different types of normal soft tissues (small bowel, lung, spleen, liver, colon, and stomach) and different kinds of artificial soft tissue replication materials (latex/silicone) for simulation purposes. In addition, subjective tests of ranking stiffness of silicone materials using the FREG teleoperation mode showed significant improvement in the performance compared to the standard endoscopic grasper. Moreover, the FREG performance was closer to the performance of the human hand than the standard endoscopic grasper.

This typically limits the project to a segment of the total manufacturing design cycle. For a manufacturing project such as that to produce a plastic part, this translates to doing the product design or the tooling design, but not both. This paper describes an innovative approach to the problem using the injection molding process as an example of a manufacturing process. Students use commercial solid modeling software to do the product design of a fairly simple part, for example a golf divot tool. The product design is then used to develop tooling (molds), to simulate structural performance and molding characteristics, and generate the NC code to machine the tooling. Once the tooling is finished it is placed on a lab injection molder and the process is tested and optimized. The entire lab experience is completed in approximately 30 hours of laboratory time, The equipment and software used to complete the project are typical of that available in undergraduate engineering facilities.","0190-5848","0-7803-7444","10.1109/FIE.2002.1158228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158228","","Education;Product design;Plastics;Injection molding;Manufacturing processes;Solid modeling;Software tools;Character generation;Testing;Laboratories","product development;project engineering;manufacturing processes;engineering education;educational courses;student experiments","manufacturing design cycle teaching;project course;manufacturing project;plastic product development;injection molding process;manufacturing process;commercial solid modeling software;golf divot tool;structural performance;molding characteristics;NC code;machine tooling;student laboratory experiments;undergraduate engineering facilities","","","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when the modules are many, other methods have to be adopted. We use fuzzy set technology for the purpose in the particular application of a Handwritten Address Interpretation System. We use a fuzzy measure based on the topology of the ""blind"" set of handwritten addresses and a predetermined neighborhood to construct the fuzzy membership function.

Firstly, these constraints are taken into account when determining Pareto dominance. As a result, a strict partial-ordered relation is obtained, and feasibility is not considered later in the selection process. Then, the orthogonal design and the statistical optimal method are generalized to MOPs, and a new type of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is constructed. In this framework, an original niche evolves first, and splits into a group of sub-niches. Then every sub-niche repeats the above process. Due to the uniformity of the search, the optimality of the statistics, and the exponential increase of the splitting frequency of the niches, OMOEA uses a deterministic search without blindness or stochasticity. It can soon yield a large set of solutions which converges to the Pareto-optimal set with high precision and uniform distribution. We take six test problems designed by Deb, Zitzler et al., and an engineering problem (W) with constraints provided by Ray et al. to test the new technique. The numerical experiments show that our algorithm is superior to other MOGAS and MOEAs, such as FFGA, NSGAII, SPEA2, and so on, in terms of the precision, quantity and distribution of solutions.

It uses statistics from a single run to accurately estimate miss ratios of fully-associative caches of arbitrary sizes and generate working-set graphs.

The results of our evaluation show that when dynamic memory disambiguation is applied in conjunction with loop unrolling, register renaming, and static memory disambiguation, the ILP of memory-intensive benchmarks can be increased by as much as 300 percent over loops where dynamic memory disambiguation is not performed.

The PDoS attacks are 'smarter' than the traditional attacks in several aspects. The most obvious one is that they require fewer attack packets to cause a similar damage. Another is that the PDoS attacks can be tuned to achieve different effects. This paper concentrates on the attack tuning part. In particular, we consider two conflicting goals involved in launching a PDoS attack: (1) maximizing the throughput degradation and (2) minimizing the risk of being detected. To address this problem, we first analyze the TCP throughput and quasi-global synchronization phenomenon caused by the PDoS attack. We then propose a family of objective functions to incorporate the two conflicting goals, and obtain the optimal attack settings. To validate the analytical results, we have carried out extensive experiments using both ns-2 simulation and a test-bed.

However, exposing all possible array reuse with scalars may cause a significant increase in register pressure, resulting in register spilling and performance degradation. We present a low cost method to predict the register pressure of a loop before applying scalar replacement on high-level source code, called pseudo-schedule register prediction (PRP), that takes into account the effects of both software pipelining and register allocation. PRP attempts to eliminate the possibility of degradation from scalar replacement due to register spilling while providing opportunities for a good speedup. PRP uses three approximation algorithms: one for constructing a data dependence graph, one for computing the recurrence constraints of a software pipelined loop, and one for building a pseudo-schedule. Our experiments show that PRP predicts the floating-point register pressure within 2 registers and the integer register pressure within 2.7 registers on average with a time complexity of O(n/sup 2/) in practice. PRP achieves similar performance to the best previous approach, having O(n/sup 3/) complexity, with less than one-fourth of the compilation time on our test suite.","0190-3918","0-7695-2197","10.1109/ICPP.2004.1327911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327911","","Registers;Pipeline processing;Degradation;Software algorithms;Software performance;Filling;Computer science;Costs;Approximation algorithms;Buildings","optimising compilers;computational complexity;pipeline processing;program control structures","register-pressure prediction;scalar replacement;memory access;pseudo-schedule register prediction;software pipelining;register allocation;data dependence graph;floating-point register;time complexity","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those are (1) optimization across multiplexors, (2) optimization across design boundaries (restricted notion of [3]), and (3) optimization across multiplications.

The approach partitions, schedules, and voltage scales multi-rate specifications given as task graphs with multiple deadlines. A distinguishing feature of the proposed synthesis is the utilisation of a generalised DVS method. In contrast to previous techniques, which ""simply"" exploit available slack time, this generalised technique additionally considers the PE power profile during a refined voltage selection to further increase the energy savings. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. We report up to 43.2% higher energy reductions compared to previous DVS scheduling approaches based on constructive techniques and total energy savings of up to 82.9% for mapping and scheduling optimised DVS systems.","1530-1591","0-7695-1471","10.1109/DATE.2002.998349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998349","","Energy efficiency;Voltage control;Embedded system;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Microprocessors;Timing;Switches;Dynamic scheduling","embedded systems;genetic algorithms;circuit optimisation;processor scheduling;hardware-software codesign;timing;logic partitioning;low-power electronics","DVS enabled distributed embedded systems;energy-efficient mapping;scheduling;two-step iterative synthesis;dynamic voltage scalable processing elements;genetic algorithms;partitioning;voltage scaling;multi-rate specifications;task graphs;multiple deadlines;processing element power profile;refined voltage selection;energy savings;energy reduction;low-energy task mapping algorithm;system level co-design","","48","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Error-tolerance","M. A. Breuer","NA","IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors, 2004. ICCD 2004. Proceedings.","","2004","","","3","","Summary form only given. Because of trends in scaling, in the near future every high performance dice can contain a massive number of defects and process aggravated noise and performance problems. In an attempt to obtain useful yields, designers and test engineers need to adopt a qualitatively different approach to their work. They need to learn, enhance and deploy techniques such as fault- and defect-tolerance. For some applications, they may even apply error-tolerance, a somewhat controversial emerging paradigm. A circuit is error-tolerant (ET) with respect to an application, if (1) it contains defects that cause internal and may cause external errors, and (2) the system that incorporates this circuit produces acceptable results. In this presentation we illustrate and give quantitative bounds on several factors that shape the future of digital design. We compare and contrast defect and fault-tolerant schemes with that of error-tolerance. We discuss how yield can be optimized by appropriately selecting the granularity of spares in light of defect densities and interconnect complexity. Finally, we show that several large classes of consumer electronic applications are resilient to errors, and how error-tolerance can then be used to significantly enhance effective yield.","1063-6404","0-7695-2231","10.1109/ICCD.2004.1347888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347888","","Digital systems;Circuit testing;Computer science;Design automation;Automatic testing;System testing;Application software;Computer errors;Design engineering;Circuit faults","integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit yield;integrated circuit interconnections;circuit complexity;consumer electronics","error tolerance;digital design;integrated circuit yield;defect density;interconnect complexity;consumer electronics","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Efficient on-the-fly data race detection in multithreaded C++ programs","E. Pozniansky; A. Schuster","Comput. Sci. Dept., Technion-Israel Inst. of Technol., Haifa, Israel; NA","Proceedings International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","","2003","","","8 pp.","","Data race detection is highly essential for debugging multithreaded programs and assuring their correctness. Nevertheless, there is no single universal technique capable of handling the task efficiently, since the data race detection problem is computationally hard in the general case. Thus, all currently available tools, when applied to some general case program, usually result in excessive false alarms or in a large number of undetected races. Another major drawback of currently available tools is that they are restricted, for performance reasons, to detection units of fixed size. Thus, they all suffer from the same problem - choosing a small unit might result in missing some of the data races, while choosing a large one might lead to false detection. We present a novel testing tool, called MultiRace, which combines improved versions of Djit and Lockset - two very powerful on-the-fly algorithms for dynamic detection of apparent data races. Both extended algorithms detect races in multithreaded programs that may execute on weak consistency systems, and may use two-way as well as global synchronization primitives. By employing novel technologies, MultiRace adjusts its detection to the native granularity of objects and variables in the program under examination. In order to monitor all accesses to each of the shared locations, MultiRace instruments the C++ source code of the program. It lets the user fine-tune the detection process, but otherwise is completely automatic and transparent. This paper describes the algorithms employed in MultiRace, gives highlights of its implementation issues, and suggests some optimizations. It shows that the overheads imposed by MultiRace are often much smaller (orders of magnitude) than those obtained by other existing tools.","1530-2075","0-7695-1926","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213513","","Multithreading;Computer science;Debugging;Testing;Heuristic algorithms;Object detection;Monitoring;Instruments;Parallel programming;Parallel processing","multi-threading;C++ language;program debugging;program verification;program testing;software tools","on-the-fly data race detection;multithreaded C++ programs;debugging;correctness;MultiRace;testing tool;Djit;Lockset;weak consistency systems;source code;fine tuning","","15","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quality metric is able to generate a perceptual distortion map for each and every video frame. A perceptual blocking distortion metric (PBDM) is introduced which utilizes this simplified quality metric. The PBDM is formulated based on the observation that blocking artifacts are noticeable only in certain regions of a picture. A method to segment blocking dominant regions is devised, and perceptual distortions in these regions are summed up to form an objective measure of blocking artifacts. Subjective and objective tests are conducted and the performance of the PBDM is assessed by a number of measures such as the Spearman rank-order correlation, the Pearson correlation, and the average absolute error The results show a strong correlation between the objective blocking ratings and the mean opinion scores on blocking artifacts.","0018-9219;1558-2256","","10.1109/5.982412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982412","","Australia;PSNR;Computer science;Software engineering;Discrete cosine transforms;Quality assessment;Distortion measurement;Testing;Standardization;Pulse modulation","video coding;brightness;image segmentation;visual perception;image resolution;physiological models;edge detection","digital-video quality;blocking artifacts;vision-model-based impairment metric;prediction accuracy;perceptual distortion map;perceptual blocking distortion metric;segmentation method;Spearman rank-order correlation;Pearson correlation;average absolute error;psychovisual experiments;spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity;contrast gain control;edge detection;MPEG-2","","84","59","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, environmental testing and monitoring of the product outputs, intended design performance and other product design parameters need to be performed. Such tests may include significant number of samples, may be time consuming and very costly. Consequently, environmental tests should be designed and planned very carefully and the data analysis methodologies should require the minimum resources for data collection.

The modules of the circuit should have large enough gate depths such that the delay and energy penalties of the level shifters connecting them are negligible. Both static and dynamic energy are considered in the optimization. Energy savings of up to 48% have been achieved on various example circuits. The first step in the optimization finds optimum supply and threshold voltages for each module in the circuit. If the circuit has a large number of modules, this step might yield a correspondingly large number of different supply and threshold voltages for minimum energy consumption. Since having a large number of different supply and threshold voltages on an IC is not feasible in current technologies, an additional step clusters the multiple voltages obtained from the first step into a fixed number of supply and threshold voltages (for example, 2 different supply voltages and 2 different threshold voltages). In addition to the application of this method to circuit optimization, it can also be applied to a wide range of problems with delay constraints, such as software tasks running on a dynamically variable V/sub DD/ and V/sub th/ processor.","","1-58113-762","10.1109/ICCAD.2003.1257885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257885","","Energy consumption;Threshold voltage;Delay;Dynamic voltage scaling;Circuit optimization;Circuit testing;Iterative algorithms;DH-HEMTs;Power engineering and energy;CMOS technology","CMOS integrated circuits;delays;circuit optimisation;gradient methods;modules;low-power electronics","minimum energy consumption;CMOS circuits;complementary metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit;multiple supply;threshold voltages;delay constraint;circuit modules;level shifters;IC;integrated circuit;circuit optimization;V/sub DD/ processor;V/sub th/ processor;gradient search algorithm","","19","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, our results show that implementing the cryptographic algorithms as system libraries does not degrade their performance significantly. Instead, they provide great flexibility and code management to the algorithms. Furthermore, the test results presented provide a basis for performance estimation of cryptosystems implemented on the PalmPilot/sup TM/.","","0-7695-1405","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991525","","Measurement;Cryptography;Handheld computers;Libraries;System testing;Seals;Microprocessors;Internet;Educational institutions;Computer science","notebook computers;cryptography;software libraries;digital arithmetic;software performance evaluation;operating systems (computers);table lookup","performance measurement;cryptographic primitives;cryptographic system libraries;Palm OS;stream ciphers;block ciphers;hash functions;multiple-precision integer arithmetic operations;SSC2;ARC4;Alleged RC4;SEAL 3.0;encryption speed;optimized Rijndael;lookup tables;code management;PalmPilot","","18","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A bank of even and odd S-Gabor filter pairs of different orientations are convolved with vascular images in order to create an external snake energy field. Each fitter pair will give maximum response to the segment of vessel having the same orientation as the filters. The resulting responses across filters of different orientations are combined to create an external energy field for snake optimization. Vessels are represented by B-Spline snakes, and are optimized on filter outputs with dynamic programming. The points of minimal constriction and the percent-diameter stenosis are determined from a computed vessel centerline. The system has been statistically validated using fixed stenosis and flexible-tube phantoms. It has also been validated on 20 coronary lesions with two independent operators, and has been tested for interoperator and intraoperator variability and reproducibility.

In particular, many modern embedded systems operate under tight memory space constraints. One way of satisfying these constraints is to compress executable code and data as much as possible. While research on code compression have studied efficient hardware and software based code strategies, many of these techniques do not take application behavior into account, that is, the same compression/decompression strategy is used irrespective of the application being optimized. This paper presents a code compression strategy based on control flow graph (CFG) representation of the embedded program. The idea is to start with a memory image wherein all basic blocks are compressed, and decompress only the blocks that are predicted to be needed in the near future. When the current access to a basic block is over, our approach also decides the point at which the block could be compressed. We propose several compression and decompression strategies that try to reduce memory requirements without excessively increasing the original instruction cycle counts.","1530-1591;1558-1101","0-7695-2288","10.1109/DATE.2005.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395694","","Embedded system;Image coding;Application software;Flow graphs;Power system reliability;Computer science;Power engineering and energy;Embedded computing;Power engineering computing;Optimization","embedded systems;data flow graphs;microprocessor chips;data compression;power consumption","access pattern-based code compression;memory-constrained embedded systems;memory space requirements;power consumption;real-time predictability;reliability;code compression;control flow graph representation;CFG representation;memory image;decompression","","4","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue has been of concern for many researchers over the years. Also, in the last several years, there has been a large and energetic upswing in neuroengineering research aimed at synthesizing fuzzy logic with computational neural networks. The two technologies often complement each other: neural networks supply the brute force necessary to accommodate and interpret large amounts of sensor data and fuzzy logic provides a structural framework that utilizes and exploits these low-level results. As a neural network is well known for its ability to represent functions, and the basis of every fuzzy model is the membership function, so the natural application of neural networks in fuzzy models has emerged to provide good approximations to the membership functions that are essential to the success of the fuzzy approach. This paper evaluates and analyzes the performance of available methods of ranking fuzzy subsets on a set of selected examples that cover possible situations we might encounter as defining fuzzy subsets at each node of a neural network. Through this analysis, suggestions as to which methods have better performance for utilization in neural network architectures, as well as criteria for choosing an appropriate method for ranking are made.","","0-8186-7126","10.1109/ISUMA.1995.527799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=527799","","Fuzzy sets;Neural networks;Fuzzy neural networks;Performance analysis;Testing;Algorithm design and analysis;Logic;Application software;Computer science;Educational institutions","fuzzy set theory;fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set ordering;neural network algorithm;fuzzy decision problems;neuroengineering research;fuzzy logic synthesis;sensor data;membership function approximation;performance;fuzzy subset ranking;ranking method selection criteria","","2","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The CSM module algorithm provides for parallel distributed operation and includes a learning classifier and meta-GA functions that work from a knowledge base (which may be distributed) in long term memory to synthesize matched channels and operational goals that are retained in short term memory.

Considerable attention was paid to the minimization of the radial component of the magnetic field at the end of the winding, where this field component, perpendicular to the tape, reduces critical current and increases AC losses. Additional laminated ferromagnetic rings shaping the magnetic field around the winding edges are used to reduce the radial field component.

A finite element method (software ANSYS) was used for optimization of the ring cross-section and their position with respect to the winding.

This DAQ is the result of a study for a cheaper solution for tool parameter optimization, which so long has been performed by telemetric sensors. For general use it is necessary to generate a highly robust DAQ system, which is very small in size. Very low power consumption, for a long active operating time with standard types of battery cells, is also required. To be a convenient replacement for telemetric circuits, the data memory is configurable with a maximum size of up to 8 MB (up to 16 or 32 MB in the near future). A local processor is required, which should be able to perform real-time data compression and, depending on the application, analog signal path filtering and/or pre data calculations (e.g. validation). The signal path consists of an analog signal conditioning line with a simple anti-aliasing filter structure and a free configurable analog to digital converter (ADC) with a maximum sampling rate of 25 kHz for one channel. For downloading of user specific hardware and software, a monitor program and a serial interface allows communication with a host terminal or standard personal computer. First testing of this design has shown a wide range of replacement for applications where intelligent sensors with telemetric capability are needed At the end of this paper, a special application in the field of computer numerically controlled machines is presented.","","0-7803-2775","10.1109/IECON.1996.566067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=566067","","Costs;Data acquisition;Telemetry;Circuits;Application software;Electronic components;Robustness;Energy consumption;Batteries;Data compression","data acquisition;computerised instrumentation;microcomputer applications;analogue-digital conversion;signal processing","data acquisition unit;free user configurable structure;costs;tool parameter optimization;CNC machines;hardware;software;analog signal conditioning line;anti-aliasing filter;analog to digital converter;monitor program;serial interface;personal computer;25 kHz;8 MB","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In parallel programs the affinity between parallel algorithms and the architecture of the target parallel computer is very important. In this paper we focus on the parallelism in view of the number of micro-tasks which are processing units in parallel programs. The presented methods estimate the optimal number of micro-tasks before the parallel processing is invoked. Furthermore, they shorten the execution time of the parallel program so that it is close to the optimal execution time. The estimation is based on the result of pre-executions of the program for different sizes of the data to be processed on a target parallel computer. One tuning method uses nearest-neighbor interpolation and the other uses spline interpolation for the estimation. We tested these tuning methods using a parallel square-matrix multiplication program written in Dataparallel C on three different parallel computers; a Paragon, an iPSC/2, and an nCUBE/2. In these experiments, the method using nearest-neighbor interpolation brought the execution time closer to the optimum than did the method using spline interpolation. The nearest-neighbor interpolation method yielded average execution times, which are given in terms of the optimal execution time, of 1.01 for the Paragon, 1.005 for the iPSC/2, and 1.052 for the nCUBE/2.<<ETX>>","","0-7803-2018","10.1109/ICAPP.1995.472244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=472244","","Concurrent computing;Parallel processing;Portable computers;Parallel algorithms;Delay;Spline;Computer architecture;Optimizing compilers;Laboratories;Parallel programming","software portability;parallel programming;software performance evaluation;computational complexity","dynamic performance tuning methods;portable parallel programs;parallel computers;parallel algorithms;micro-tasks;optimal execution time;nearest-neighbor interpolation;spline interpolation;parallel square-matrix multiplication program","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to improve the performance of TCRVQ, an entropy-constrained TCRVQ (EC-TCRVQ) is designed and implemented for non-uniformly distributed sources. The simulation results indicate a performance improvement of 1.5 dB for EC-TCRVQ over entropy-constrained trellis-coded VQ.

The control strategy considered in this study is a two-level hierarchy. The proposed two-level structure results from the decomposition of the overall problem into parallel sub-problems. This allows the retention of the closed-loop controls associated with each subsystem, which together constitute the lower level (Level I). The central coordinating controller forms the upper level (Level II). The coordination of the local controllers by the central controller, accounts for nonlinear terms and interconnections, and yields the global optimization of the overall system transient performance. The local controllers are not dependent on one another and are robust to any changes in the network configuration, due to the feedback or closed-loop control formulation inherent in the proposed strategy. To ensure physical realizability of the local controllers, the input was restricted to locally measurable signals. The methodology was implemented into a prototype software program, which was tested on a single machine connected to a very large network approximated by an infinite bus, and then on the IEEE four-generator test system. These studies considered fault clearing times greater that the critical, assuring an unstable condition. The well-damped optimal state and control trajectories illustrate the successful solution of the problem, indicating that the technique is a valuable tool dealing with transient control problems for large-scale systems.","0197-2618","0-7803-7420","10.1109/IAS.2002.1044154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044154","","Centralized control;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Software testing;System testing;Optimal control;Robust control;Feedback;Software prototyping;Large-scale systems","electricity supply industry;power system control;control system synthesis;nonlinear control systems;hierarchical systems;power system analysis computing;power system stability;control system analysis computing;closed loop systems","electric utility industry;nonlinear hierarchical controllers;control design;multiple dynamic-braking units;disturbances;transient performance;feedback;closed-loop control;control simulation;computer simulation;well-damped optimal state trajectories;large-scale systems","","","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The core of this framework is a clustering algorithm that decreases the number of nodes before expanding the SDF graph into a precedence directed acyclic graph (DAG). The internals of the clusters are then scheduled with uniprocessor SDF schedulers which can optimize for memory usage. The clustering is done in such a manner as to leave ample parallelism exposed for the multiprocessor scheduler. We have developed the SDF composition theorem for testing if a clustering step is valid.

"Pseudo-randomly generated estimator banks: a new tool for improving the threshold performance of direction finding","A. B. Gershman","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Ruhr-Univ., Bochum, Germany","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","1998","46","5","1351","1364","A new powerful tool for improving the threshold performance of direction finding is considered. The main idea of our approach is to reduce the number of outliers in the DOA estimates using a previously proposed joint estimation strategy (JES). For this purpose, multiple different DOA estimators are calculated in a parallel manner for the same batch of data (i.e. for a single data record). Employing these estimators simultaneously, the JES improves the threshold performance because it removes outliers and exploits only ""successful"" estimators that are sorted out using a hypothesis testing procedure. We consider an efficient modification of the JES with application to the pseudo-randomly generated eigenstructure estimator banks based on secondand higher order statistics. Weighted MUSIC estimators based on the covariance and contracted quadricovariance matrices are chosen as appropriate underlying techniques for the second- and fourth-order estimator banks, respectively. Computer simulations with uncorrelated sources verify the dramatic improvements of threshold performance as compared with the conventional second- and fourth-order MUSIC algorithms. Simulations also show that in the second-order case, the threshold performance of our technique is close to that of the WSF method and stochastic/deterministic ML methods, which are known today as the most powerful (in the sense of estimation performance) and, at the same time, as the most computationally expensive DOA estimation techniques. The computational cost of our algorithm is much lower than that of the WSF and ML techniques because no multidimensional optimization is required.","1053-587X;1941-0476","","10.1109/78.668797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=668797","","Direction of arrival estimation;Multiple signal classification;Testing;Application software;Higher order statistics;Covariance matrix;Computer simulation;Computational modeling;Stochastic processes;Maximum likelihood estimation","direction-of-arrival estimation;array signal processing;higher order statistics;parameter estimation;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;computational complexity;random processes","pseudo-randomly generated estimator banks;threshold performance;direction finding;DOA estimates;joint estimation strategy;data record;successful estimators;outliers reduction;hypothesis testing;eigenstructure estimator;second-order statistics;higher order statistics;weighted MUSIC estimators;covariance;quadricovariance matrices;fourth-order estimator banks;second-order estimator banks;computer simulations;uncorrelated sources;MUSIC algorithms;stochastic/deterministic ML methods;estimation performance;computational cost","","49","44","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The separation properties of the nonuniform traveling wave field was investigated by studying the amplitude of its spatial harmonics. Finite element software was used to model the spatial distribution of an electric field created by electrodes of different shapes. It was established that cylindrical, square, and stripe electrodes produce the most optimized field distribution. Based on the modeling results, several flatbed traveling wave panels with stripe and cylindrical electrodes were constructed and tested. The separation characteristics of the panels were assessed by examining the direction of transport of a two-powder mixture with different size distributions for AC frequencies up to 300 Hz. It was discovered that, for the majority of panels, successful powder separation could be achieved for two frequency bands. The position of the bands depended mainly on electrode geometry (i.e., pitch and width).

First, the architecture simplifies the process of implementing protocols in the kernel, making it easier to build and test novel protocols.

While there is no limitation on the use of simulation, the general consensus is that an analytical solution, if one is possible, is always to be preferred to simulation as a methodology. In the field of information systems, client-server models exhibit a degree of complexity and richness not amenable to easy analytical solutions, except for some specific algorithms useful in limited contexts. Simulation could, therefore, be a good strategy to analyse the client-server systems and help in better implementation of feasible solutions. This paper examines the current state of client-server models and use of simulation in dealing with the problems encountered. The paper then compares the seven-layer OSI model for communications architecture and recommends that a similarly layered approach is likely to prove useful in simulating client-server systems. In the process, the paper also points out that the simulation models bring into a sharp focus the importance of software metrics, an area of vital importance in software development.","","0-7803-3383","10.1109/WSC.1996.873426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=873426","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Client-server systems;Visualization;Information systems;Information analysis;Software metrics;Computer simulation;System testing;Australia","","","","","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This fact degrades the applicability of a GA for most of the real-world problems and users. Therefore, this article discusses some possibilities with setting GA parameters.

The router is optimized for voice transmission in the mobile base station network. IP Header Compression (RFC 2507), compresses and restores long headers of packets in point-to-point message streams improving bandwidth utilization and real-time characteristics. The function was implemented in FPGA technology using a new high-level design language based on the software language ANSI-C. The design method used is similar to methods for software design. The resulting hardware can be tested in full speed on a PCI-board. In a parallel effort, a second group of designers using the same specification implemented the same functionality using traditional hardware design methods and tools. This enabled us to compare the efficiency of the two design methods. Using the new methods, the design was completed 3-4 times faster with similar results in terms of speed and area. This can be attributed to support for sequential logic and a compact representation in the language and to a software-like design methodology with fast turnaround in the design environment.","","0-7695-1239","10.1109/DSD.2001.952110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952110","","Internet;Design methodology;Hardware;Design engineering;Base stations;Bandwidth;Field programmable gate arrays;Software design;Testing;Logic design","project engineering;Internet;logic design;field programmable gate arrays","header compression;Handel-C;Internet;design language;ESPRIT project;Ericsson IPv6 router RXI820;voice transmission;mobile base station network;point-to-point message streams;bandwidth utilization;real-time characteristics;FPGA technology;software language ANSI-C;sequential logic;software-like design methodology","","4","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EPS, however, leaves behind many renaming copy instructions that cannot be coalesced due to interferences. These copies take resources and, more seriously, they may cause a stall if they rename a multilatency instruction whose latency is longer than the II aimed for by EPS. This paper proposes a code transformation technique based on loop unrolling which makes those copies coalescible. Two unique features of the technique are its method of determining the precise unroll amount, based on an idea of extended live ranges, and its insertion of special bookkeeping copies at loop exits. The proposed technique enables EPS to avoid a serious slowdown from latency handling and resource pressure, while keeping its variable II and other advantages. In fact, renaming through copies, followed by unroll-based copy elimination, is EPS's solution to the cross-iteration register overwrite problem in software pipelining. It works for loops with arbitrary control flow that EPS must deal with, as well as for straightline loops. Our empirical study performed on a VLIW testbed with a two-cycle load latency shows that 86 percent of the otherwise uncoalescible copies in innermost loops become coalescible when unrolled 2.2 times on average. In addition, it is demonstrated that the unroll amount obtained is precise and the most efficient. The unrolled version of the VLIW code includes fewer no-op VLIW caused by stalls, improving the performance by a geometric mean of 18 percent on a 16-ALU machine.","0018-9340;1557-9956;2326-3814","","10.1109/TC.2002.1032620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1032620","","Pipeline processing;Interference;Delay;VLIW;Moon;Motion control;Performance evaluation;Testing;Optimizing compilers","processor scheduling;program control structures;pipeline processing;delays;performance evaluation;program processors;optimising compilers;parallelising compilers;programming theory","unroll-based copy elimination;enhanced pipeline scheduling;EPS;software pipelining;variable initiation interval;control flow;coalescible copies;extended live ranges;special bookkeeping copies;loop exits;code motion pipelining;latency handling;renaming;arbitrary control flow;straightline loops;VLIW testbed;two-cycle load latency;innermost loops;unroll amount;performance;cross-iteration register overwrite problem;modulo scheduling;modulo variable expansion;register allocation;iterated coalescing;code transformation technique;loop unrolling","","2","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objects are discs of equal size placed within a rigid boundary. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, analytical results for three types of regular, periodic arrangements-the hexagonal, square, and triangular placements-are presented. The regular arrangements are analyzed for rectangular boundaries and radii of discs that are small compared to the area of the placement region, because, in this case, the influence of boundary conditions can be neglected. This situation is called the unbounded case. They show that, for the unbounded case among the three regular placements, the type of hexagonal arrangements provides the largest number of placed units for the same deformation depth. Furthermore, it can be proved that these regular placements are not too far from the truly optimal arrangements. For example, hexagonal placements differ at most by the factor of 1.1 from the largest possible number of generally shaped units in arbitrary arrangements. These analytical results are used as guidances for testing stochastic algorithms optimizing placements of flexible objects. In the second part, mainly two problems are considered: the underlying physical model and a simulated annealing algorithm maximizing the number of flexible discs in equilibrium placements. Along with the physical model, an approximate formula is derived, reflecting the deformation/force relationship for a large range of deformations.","0018-9340;1557-9956;2326-3814","","10.1109/12.609278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=609278","","Computer aided software engineering;Algorithm design and analysis;Stochastic processes;Simulated annealing;Shape;Elasticity;Boundary conditions;Testing;Deformable models;Amorphous materials","simulated annealing;deformation;testing;algorithm theory;computational geometry","optimal 2D flexible object placement;analytical results;unbounded case;rigid boundary;discs;regular periodic arrangements;hexagonal placements;square placements;triangular placements;stochastic algorithm testing;physical model;simulated annealing algorithm;maximized flexible discs;equilibrium placements;approximate formula;deformation/force relationship","","3","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm provides acceptable sensitivities of optimal solutions under the consideration of all important operational and security constraints. The optimal solutions need not be exact. This is especially important for real-time applications where only approximate, but close to the true optimum, solutions are available.

Planning is a human's preferred problem solving methodology because we are intelligent creatures with high-level communication skills. Due to the intelligence of the agents, human swarms can be quickly programmed, for subsequent observation and analysis. This paper describes human swarm experiments designed for gathering information on swarm algorithms. At these events 100 volunteers, wearing data-encoded T-shirts, work together to perform tasks of differing degrees of complexity. Researchers provide simple instructions for each task (programming the swarm), record the swarm's behavior (videotaped observation) and analyze the results (problem identification and algorithm-mining).

To achieve this the distance between successive reuses of the same data block must be reduced. However, this may not be possible in many cases due to data dependences between computations assigned to different processors. This paper focuses on software-managed on-chip memory space utilization for embedded chip multiprocessors and proposes a compression-based approach to reduce the memory space occupied by data blocks with large inter-processor reuse distances. The proposed approach has two major components: a compiler and an ILP (integer linear programming) solver. The compiler's job is to analyze the application code and extract information on data access patterns. This access pattern information is then passed to our ILP solver, which determines the data blocks to compress/decompress and the times (the program points) at which to compress/decompress them. We tested the effectiveness of this ILP based approach using access patterns extracted by our compiler from application codes. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed approach is very effective in reducing power consumption. Moreover, it leads to a lower energy consumption than an alternate scheme evaluated in our experiments for all the test cases studied.","","1-59593-161","10.1145/1084834.1084860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4076318","chip multiprocessors;data compression;optimizing compiler","Data compression;Data mining;Testing;Energy consumption;Space technology;Costs;Program processors;Integer linear programming;Information analysis;Pattern analysis","","","","2","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have analyzed both classes in terms of a set of performance properties: data locality, memory overhead, parallelism and workload balancing. We propose several techniques to increase the exploited parallelism and to introduce load balancing into a DPO method. Regarding parallelism, the solution is based on the partial expansion of the reduction array. For load balancing, the first technique is generic, as it can deal with any kind of load unbalance present in the problem domain. The second technique handles a special case of load unbalancing appearing when there are a large number of write operations on small regions of the reduction arrays. Efficient implementations of the proposed optimizing solutions for the DWA-LIP (data write affinity-loop index prefetching) DPO method are presented, experimentally tested on static and dynamic kernel codes, and compared with other parallel reduction methods.","","0-7695-1444","10.1109/EMPDP.2002.994330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994330","","Yarn;Parallel processing;Privatization;Computer architecture;Load management;Optimization methods;Testing;Kernel;Concurrent computing;Optical computing","parallel algorithms;shared memory systems;resource allocation;arrays;numerical analysis;software performance evaluation","data partitioning-oriented parallel irregular reductions;performance improvement;parallelization techniques;loop partitioning-oriented techniques;performance properties;data locality;memory overhead;parallelism;workload balancing;reduction array partial expansion;load unbalancing;write operations;optimizing solutions;DWA-LIP method;data-write affinity;loop-index prefetching;static kernel codes;dynamic kernel codes","","1","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fourth International Conference on Data Engineering","","1988","","","40","50","A model is presented for an adaptable system that allows online switching of classes of algorithms for database transaction processing. The basic idea is to identify conditions on the state of processing that will maintain consistency during the switch from one class to another. The classes of concurrency control algorithms and the formalism of history for transaction processing and serializability have been used to develop this research. In addition to the formalism, the precise conditions for switching digraph-serializable (DSR) algorithms have been given. This research is being applied to switching network partition protocols (conservative to optimistic), commit protocols, recovery block software, and has led towards the design of an adaptable and reconfigurable distributed database system. An experimental system called RAID has been implemented to test these ideas; it has been noted that adaptability provides for varying performance requirements and deals with failures of sites, transactions, and other components of the system.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-0827","10.1109/ICDE.1988.105444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=105444","","Concurrency control;Partitioning algorithms;Application software;Transaction databases;Switches;Protocols;Optimization methods;Distributed databases;History;Design optimization","database theory;distributed databases;protocols","diagram serializable algorithms;model;adaptable systems;transaction processing;online switching;concurrency control algorithms;serializability;switching network partition protocols;commit protocols;recovery block software;distributed database system;RAID","","3","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ICSLP '96","","1996","1","","224","227 vol.1","We present a continuous speech recognition architecture with a tightly coupled language model that tries to improve the dwindling performance of the normal stack decoder with increasing lexicon size. We solve the problem of recognition by means of two mutually recursive functions. The first one uses an auxiliary retrieval function to obtain lexicalized (already built) solutions to the problem, and merges these solutions with the ones built by the second function. This second one describes the acoustical and semantic recognition process as a search problem defined with the help of the first function, and solved with the help of the A* strategy. As a linguistic model, we use a hierarchy of linguistic levels each of which has a particular meaning structure, a lexicon of lexicalized forms, their lexicalization probabilities, and a local lexical grammar describing how the semantic categories of the level can be built. The process can further be optimized if targets, constraints on the possible solutions, are given to the recognition process to guide and restrict it. Target guidance implies a mechanism for target focusing, locally matching targets to the recognition state, and target prediction with the help of a lexical local grammar. We are testing the architecture in a DARPA RM-like application.","","0-7803-3555","10.1109/ICSLP.1996.607082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=607082","","Natural languages;Decoding;Speech recognition;Search problems;Target recognition;Cost function;Constraint optimization;Testing;Buildings;Horses","speech recognition;natural language interfaces;computational linguistics;software performance evaluation;recursive functions;search problems;grammars","multi-level lexical-semantics;language model design;guided integrated continuous speech recognition;performance;normal stack decoder;lexicon size;mutually recursive functions;retrieval function;acoustical recognition;semantic recognition;search problem;A* strategy;linguistic model;lexicon;local lexical grammar;optimization;DARPA RM","","","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Labs., Palo Alto, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","","2001","49","4","567","573","When using the method of moments to solve scattering problems, a crucial factor is the appropriate choice of basis functions. A judicious choice of the basis functions can lead to a sparse impedance matrix or to a sparse solution vector, both of which will reduce the computational burden. However, pulse basis functions are usually used, both due to their simple description and because there are already many software tools written for this aim. Therefore, some efforts have been invested in transforming a formulation that is the result of using pulse basis functions to one using preferred basis functions. This transform produces grouping of the pulse functions into a new, more appropriate set of basis functions. This paper discusses the search for an optimal grouping, where optimality is measured in terms of the sparseness of the resulting solution vector. Various options are demonstrated and discussed, and numerical examples are given. It is important to note that the optimal grouping suggested herein is expected to be optimal on the average, when tried on many sample problems. Adjusting the optimization to a more specific set of problems and scenarios will lead to even better performances and is a viable option in practical cases.","0018-926X;1558-2221","","10.1109/8.923316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923316","","Sparse matrices;Impedance;Scattering;Moment methods;Testing;Software tools;Helium;Degradation;Canning","electromagnetic wave scattering;impedance matrix;optimisation;method of moments;sparse matrices","optimal grouping;basis functions;method of moments;scattering problems;sparse impedance matrix;sparse solution vector;pulse basis functions;software tools;transform;EM wave scattering;matrices","","2","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper reviews the work undertaken to determine the optimum process flow in order to achieve the desired electrical performance, and analysis of the predicted breakdown distribution. A comparison is made to actual distributions obtained from silicon. Then, from experimental split lots, a sensitivity analysis is performed. A comparison of simulated and actual results are compared.

For this reason, a thermal analysis of the accuracy of usual techniques for modelling the different components of a memory module is afforded in this paper. A first theoretical analysis of the characteristics and problems of the different components (DRAMs and PCB) is first performed. Regarding DRAMs, a static compact model is extracted from its detailed description by the use of a FEM software. This extraction involves an optimisation procedure of an error function based on a set of boundary conditions. A proposal of a physically-motivated error function is provided. For the PCB, a simplified model is extracted also from a detailed FEM model, but with reduced number of boundary conditions. A measurement setup has been developed with the intention to study the goodness of the developed models. For this reason, two simplified boundary conditions sets were used: simple natural convection and optimised board cooling condition, which could allow us to avoid inaccuracies in the environment conditions when performing the correlation of simulation results. Simulation results have been compared with measurements, providing a good correlation. For a simple natural convection boundary, results are providing a good accuracy for both compact models: the five resistance model and the simple two resistance model. For the optimised board cooling condition, the two resistance model is overestimating the cooling conditions through the PCB thermal connection. Only a disagreement is obtained in the temperature distribution of DRAM case temperature over the module. The reason is thought to be the unequal power distribution over the DRAMs.","","0-7803-9062","10.1109/ESIME.2005.1502789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1502789","","Boundary conditions;Random access memory;Cooling;Predictive models;Temperature distribution;Energy consumption;Uncertainty;Packaging;Appropriate technology;Performance analysis","thermal management (packaging);modules;DRAM chips;printed circuits;thermal analysis;integrated circuit testing;finite element analysis;natural convection;electronic engineering computing","memory module characterization;junction temperatures;thermal analysis;printed circuit boards;static compact model;FEM software;optimisation procedure;physically-motivated error function;simple natural convection;optimised board cooling condition;simulation;resistance model;PCB thermal connection;temperature distribution;DRAM case temperature;power distribution","","1","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is composed of two stages, the LVL2 trigger and the event filter (EF). The LVL2 trigger performs event selection with optimized algorithms using selected data guided by Region of Interest pointers provided by the LVL1 trigger. Those events selected by LVL2 are built into complete events, which are passed to the EF for a further stage of event selection and classification using off-line algorithms. Events surviving the EF selection are passed for off-line storage. The two stages of HLT are implemented on processor farms. The concept of distributing the selection process between LVL2 and EF is a key element in the architecture, which allows it to be flexible to changes (luminosity, detector knowledge, background conditions, etc.) Although there are some differences in the requirements between these subsystems there are many commonalities. An overview of the dataflow (event selection) and supervision (control, configuration, monitoring) activities in the HLT is given, highlighting where commonalities between the two subsystems can be exploited and indicating where requirements dictate that implementations differ.

We present an automated method for tuning two-level caches to embedded applications for reduced energy consumption. The method is applicable to both a simulation-based exploration environment and a hardware-based system prototyping environment. We introduce the two-level cache tuner, or TCaT - a heuristic for searching the huge solution space of possible configurations. The heuristic interlaces the exploration of the two cache levels and searches the various cache parameters in a specific order based on their impact on energy. We show the integrity of our heuristic across multiple memory configurations and even in the presence of hardware/software partitioning - a common optimization capable of achieving significant speedups and/or reduced energy consumption. We apply our exploration heuristic to a large set of embedded applications. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our heuristic: on average the heuristic examines only 7% of the possible cache configurations, but results in cache sub-system energy savings of 53%, only 1% more than the optimal cache configuration. In addition, the configured cache achieves an average speedup of 30% over the base cache configuration due to tuning of cache line size to the application's needs.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268850","","Microprocessors;Runtime;Energy consumption;Hardware;Process design;Virtual prototyping;Tuners;Application software;Embedded system;Space exploration","microprocessor chips;cache storage;circuit tuning;embedded systems;memory architecture","automatic tuning;two-level caches;embedded applications;memory hierarchy;microprocessor;energy consumption;simulation-based exploration environment;hardware-based system prototyping environment;TCaT;cache parameters;multiple memory configurations;hardware-software partitioning;base cache configuration;cache line size;configurable cache;cache hierarchy;architecture tuning","","47","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed general method of analysis is based on probabilistic and information theory results. As the first and necessary step for a statistical analysis, several probabilistic models for random tables and relations have been investigated. The outline of possible further practical applications may be as the follows (i) fitting the corresponding stochastic model; (ii) estimation of the model parameters for a given data; (iii) approximation and analysis of key system characteristics.

To capture the remainder of the data dependence history we introduce disambiguation checks in the program whose control flow signatures capture the results of the checks. The resulting extended control flow trace enables the recovery of otherwise unrecoverable data dependences. The code for the checks is designed to minimize the increase in the program execution time and the extended control flow trace size when compared to directly collecting control flow and dependence traces.

We present an executable model for a family of algorithms dealing with leader election in a ring topology. We follow the traditional approach of system family engineering. That is, we develop a feature model that captures variability across these algorithms. We then proceed to produce a generator. This generator receives as inputs specific values for each of the variation points (i.e., features) we identify. And it produces the behavior corresponding to the specific configuration of features at hand. Contrary to existing generative programming literature, we do not resort to C++ meta-programming but instead develop an executable model using Rational Rose RT. More precisely, we have designed a single state chart that can model all the algorithms of the family we studied. We focus here on how to obtain such a state chart, rather than on the identification of the features we used, or on ROSE-RT semantics. We do believe however that our approach can be reused to provide a semantically unified and executable modelling approach for other families of algorithms.","","0-7695-2132","10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1303186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303186","","Nominations and elections;Topology;Systems engineering and theory;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing;Computer science;Drives;Design optimization;Costs;Software engineering","topology;systems engineering;distributed algorithms","ring topology;system family engineering;generative programming;C++ meta-programming;state chart;ROSE-RT semantics;election algorithms","","","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a parameter space, by altering the shape of the objective function, the original problem instance is transformed into a series of gradually simplified problem instances with smoother terrain surfaces. Using an existing local search algorithm, an instance with the simplest terrain structure is solved first, the original problem instance with more complicated terrain structure is solved last, and the solutions of the simplified problem instances are used to guide the search of more complicated ones. A case study of using such technique to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is described. We tested this method with numerous randomly generated TSP instances. We found that it has significantly improved the performance of existing heuristic search algorithms.<<ETX>>","0018-9472;2168-2909","","10.1109/21.293486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=293486","","Space exploration;Smoothing methods;Computer aided software engineering;Traveling salesman problems;Heuristic algorithms;Cities and towns;Search methods;Testing;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness","operations research;search problems;combinatorial mathematics;optimisation;heuristic programming","efficient local search;search space smoothing;traveling salesman problem;TSP;combinatorial optimization;rugged terrain;locally optimum configuration;heuristic search algorithm","","50","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SPSA avoids the need for detailed modeling of the sensor response by simply relying on observed responses as obtained by limited experimentation with test sensor configurations.

The success of a decision support system relies mainly on its capability of processing large amounts of data and efficiently extracting useful knowledge from the data, especially knowledge which is previously unknown to the decision makers. With a large scale system, traditional knowledge acquisition models become inefficient and/or more biased, due to the subjectivity of the experts or the pre-assumptions of certain ideas or algorithmic procedures. Today, with the rapid development of computer technologies, the capability of collecting data has been greatly advanced. Data becomes the most valuable resource for an organization. We present a fundamental framework toward intelligent decision support by analyzing a large amount of mixed-mode data (data with a mixture of continuous and categorical values) in order to bridge the subjectivity and objectivity of a decision support process. By considering significant associations of artifacts (events) inherent in the data as patterns, we define patterns as statistically significant associations among feature values represented by joint events or hypercells in the feature space. We then present an algorithm which automatically discovers statistically significant hypercells (patterns) based on: 1) a residual analysis, which tests the significance of the deviation when the occurrence of a hypercell differs from its expectation, and 2) an optimization formulation to enable recursive discovery. By discovering patterns from data sets based on such an objective measure, the nature of the problem domain will be revealed. The patterns can then be applied to solve specific problems as being interpreted or inferred with.","1094-6977;1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2003.809869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193066","","Data mining;Large-scale systems;Decision support systems;Pattern analysis;Artificial intelligence;Software systems;Knowledge acquisition;Bridges;Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic testing","pattern recognition;decision support systems;data mining;very large databases;data analysis;optimisation;probability","pattern discovery;data driven approach;decision support system;knowledge acquisition;organization;data analysis;data mining;residual analysis;statistically significant hypercells;optimization;data sets;probabilistic density functions;association rules;pattern based data query","","36","44","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main aim of this simulator is to predict the energy balance and economic behaviour of PV buildings connected to the utility grid so that different alternatives can be tested to optimise designs. Consumption analysis is performed by considering six parameters that determine the building's response, following a methodology based on data from monitored buildings, an internal reference building and regression analysis. Photovoltaic energy estimates are obtained by calculating solar radiation hourly values and simulating individual PV cells. The resulting energy balance and the economic behaviour of the building are then estimated and the results given in tables, diagrams and several graphic formats. As an example, a university office building located in Madrid (Spain) is presented and the conclusions reached during several simulation runs are discussed. To make the tool widely available to any potential users it has been programmed in a Java applet format and deployed on a World Wide Web server.

Traditional error-control schemes are not attractive because they either add redundant information that may worsen network traffic, or rely solely on decoders with inadequate error concealment. This paper presents a joint sender-receiver approach in designing transforms for multiple-description coding in order to conceal network losses in streaming real-time video over the Internet. On the receiver side, we adopt a simple interpolation-based reconstruction, as sophisticated concealment techniques cannot be employed in software-based real-time playback. On the sender side, we design an optimized reconstruction-based discrete cosine transform (ORB-DCT) with the objective of minimizing the mean squared error, assuming that some of the descriptions are lost and that the missing information is reconstructed by simple averaging at the destination. Experimental results show that our proposed ORB-DCT performs better than the original DCT in real Internet tests. Future research includes finding a perceptual-based quantization matrix based on extended basis images derived for reconstruction, and incorporating the effects of quantization and inverse quantization in the design.","","0-7803-6536","10.1109/ICME.2000.869594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869594","","Streaming media;Discrete cosine transforms;Image reconstruction;Quantization;IP networks;Computer errors;Telecommunication traffic;Decoding;Discrete transforms;Design optimization","Internet;Discrete cosine transforms;Video coding;Quantization (signal);Interpolation;Image reconstruction","video data streaming;unreliable IP networks;network traffic;sender-receiver approach;multiple-description coding;network losses;Internet;interpolation-based reconstruction;optimized reconstruction-based discrete cosine transform;minimized mean squared error;perceptual-based quantization matrix;extended basis images;inverse quantization","","1","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the cache accesses usually contribute significantly to the total power consumption of the chip. Based on the observation that an overwhelming majority of the cache access bits are '0', in this paper we propose a value-conscious (VC) cache to reduce the average cache power consumption during an access. Unlike the conventional cache with differential-bitline implementation, the VC cache is a single-bitline design. Depending on the access bit value, the VC cache can dynamically prevent the bitline from being discharged such that the power dissipated in accessing '0' is much less than the power dissipated in accessing '1'. The implementation of the VC cache is a circuit-level technique, which is software independent and orthogonal to other low power techniques at architecture-level. The experimental results based on the SPEC2000 and MediaBench traces show that without compromise of both performance and stability, by exploiting the prevalence of '0' bits in access data the VC cache can reduce the average cache read and write power by about 18%/spl sim/22% and 36%/spl sim/40%, respectively.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268821","","Virtual colonoscopy;Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Writing;Bridge circuits;Circuit stability;Pressing;Batteries;Random access memory;Capacitance","microprocessor chips;cache storage;memory architecture;circuit optimisation;low-power electronics","value-conscious cache;cache access power reduction;VC;average cache power consumption;single-bitline design;access bit value;circuit-level technique;software independent;low power techniques;architecture-level;SPEC2000;MediaBench;access data","","1","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems are less amenable to traditional worst-case real-time analysis. Instead, system-wide feedback control is needed to meet performance requirements. In this paper, we extend our previous work on developing software control algorithms based on a theory of feedback control to distributed systems. Our approach makes three important contributions. First, it allows the designer for a distributed real-time application to specify the desired temporal behavior of system adaptation, such as the speed of convergence to desired performance upon load or resource changes. This is in contrast to specifying only steady-state metrics, e.g., deadline miss ratio. Second, unlike QoS optimization approaches, our solution meets performance guarantees without accurate knowledge of task execution parameters-a key advantage in an unpredictable environment. Third, in contrast to ad hoc algorithms based on intuition and testing, our solution has a basis in the theory and practice of feedback control scheduling. Performance evaluation reveals that the solution not only has excellent steady state behavior, but also meets stability, overshoot, and settling time requirements. We also show that the solution outperforms several other algorithms available in the literature.","","0-7695-1420","10.1109/REAL.2001.990596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990596","","Feedback control;Real time systems;Application software;Steady-state;Open systems;Control systems;Software algorithms;Scheduling algorithm;Testing;Stability","real-time systems;scheduling;distributed processing;feedback","real-time systems;software control algorithms;feedback control;distributed systems;distributed real-time application;soft real-time systems","","44","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, memory energy consumption of array-intensive applications can be overwhelming due to poor cache locality. One option for reducing memory energy is to adopt a banked memory architecture, where memory space is divided into banks and each bank can be powered down if it is not in active use. An important issue here is the bank access pattern, which determines opportunities for saving energy. In this paper, we present a compiler-based data layout transformation strategy for increasing the effectiveness of a banked memory architecture. The idea is to transform the array layouts in memory in such a way that two loop iterations executed one after another access the data in the same bank as much as possible; the remaining banks can be placed into a low-power mode. Our simulation-based experiments with nine array-intensive applications show significant savings in memory energy consumption.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085","10.1109/DATE.2004.1268896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268896","","Energy consumption;Costs;Memory architecture;SDRAM;Computer science;Power engineering and energy;Clocks;Frequency;Application software;Banking","memory architecture;integrated circuit design;circuit optimisation;low-power electronics","data transformations;memory bank locality;clock frequency;clock deliverable performance;memory energy consumption;array-intensive applications;cache locality;banked memory architecture;memory space;bank access pattern;data layout transformation strategy;array layouts;loop iterations;low-power mode;memory banking;operating modes","","7","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A high-performance SAW (surface acoustic wave) filter module was designed to provide IF (intermediate frequency) filtering after the baseband signal was converted to a center frequency of 304 MHz. The 44-MHz-wide filter module showed typical passband ripple less than 0.4 dB peak-to-peak. Triple transit, electromagnetic feedthrough, and other spurious responses were rejected by at least 50 dB. The circuit, the SAW filter, and its package were designed with careful attention to parasitics in order to achieve this performance. The filtering was accomplished by two identical SAW filters on 128 degrees Y-rotated, X LiNbO/sub 3/ operated in cascade, with isolation amplifiers buffering each filter. The isolation amplifiers were designed to provide a low-impedance, balanced termination to each IDT (interdigital transducer), minimizing triple transit and EM feedthrough. The SAW filter was designed using the Remez exchange algorithm and optimized to compensate for and reduce second-order effects. An absorbing layer of polyimide was an important factor in assuring repeatably low spurious time-domain responses from the chip edges, while being compatible with 300 degrees C package sealing. An on-wafer test hardware and software system was developed to predict packaged-device ripple performance and a precision test fixture with two-port calibration standards was developed to test feedthrough and spurious time-domain responses in the same environment as the final circuit.<<ETX>>","","","10.1109/ULTSYM.1989.66965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=66965","","SAW filters;Circuit testing;Packaging;Software testing;System testing;Surface acoustic waves;Frequency conversion;Filtering;Time domain analysis;Frequency synthesizers","acoustic generators;acoustic signal processing;signal synthesis;surface acoustic wave filters;ultrasonic devices","intermediate frequency filtering;ultra-flat SAW filter module;frequency agile signal source;direct digital synthesis;isolation amplifiers;interdigital transducer;triple transit;EM feedthrough;Remez exchange algorithm;second-order effects;polyimide;ripple;time-domain responses;14 to 58 MHz;10 MHz to 3 GHz;0.4 dB;304 MHz;LiNbO/sub 3/","","","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new analytic displays and metrics are illustrated using data obtained on a LAM 4520XL at STMicroelectronics as part of a SEMATECH SPIT beta test evaluation. The DNC represents a comprehensive modeling environment that uses as its input extensive process chamber information and history of the time since maintenance actions occurred. The DNC uses a neural network to predict multiple quality output metrics and a closed-loop risk-based optimization to maximize process quality performance while minimizing overall cost of tool operation and machine downtime. The software responds in an advisory mode on a wafer-to-wafer basis as to the optimal actions to be taken. In this paper, we present three specific instances of patterns arising during wafer processing over time that signal the process or equipment engineer to the need for corrective action: either a process setpoint adjustment or specific maintenance actions. Based on the controller's recommended corrective action set with the overall risk reduction predicted by such actions, a metric of corrective action ""urgency"" can be created. The tracking of this metric over time yields different pattern types that signify a quantified need for a specific type of corrective action. Three basic urgency patterns are found: 1. a pattern in a given maintenance action over time showing increasing urgency or ""risk reduction"" capability for the action; 2. a pattern in a process variable specific to a given recipe indicating a chronic request over time to only adjust the variable setpoint either above or below the current target; 3. a pattern in a process variable existing over all recipes processed through the chamber indicating chronic request to adjust the variable setpoint in either or both directions over time. This pattern is a pointer to the need for a maintenance action that is either corroborated by the urgency graph for that maintenance action, or if no such action has been previously taken, a guide to the source of the equipment malfunction.","1078-8743","0-7803-7673-00-7803-7681","10.1109/ASMC.2003.1194514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194514","","Process control;Risk management;Costs;Manufacturing processes;Pulp manufacturing;Semiconductor device manufacture;Displays;Testing;Semiconductor device modeling;History","semiconductor device manufacture;neurocontrollers;maintenance engineering;process control;closed loop systems","dynamic neural controller;process optimization;parts maintenance;semiconductor manufacturing;closed-loop control;urgency metric;risk analysis;wafer-to-wafer advisory;advanced process control","","","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of this study was to obtain experimental data allowing for selection of the best imaging geometry to detect small lesions labeled with Tc-99m. The design of the small scintimammography gamma camera prototypes used in these studies, with an active FOV from 10 cm/spl times/10 cm and 15 cm/spl times/20 cm, is based on an array of Hamamatsu R7600-00-C8 position sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PSPMTs).

To establish coordination, a real-time synchronous communication is normally assumed. However, communication is often limited to asynchronous and very time delayed methods in many practical applications. The paper intends to propose a method to search for co-ordinated plans under limited information exchange. Our approach is to combine on-line local optimisation by reinforcement learning (RL) and asynchronous global combinatorial optimisation by genetic algorithms. The GA search modifies RL's search direction to find a co-ordinated plan, whereas the RL tries to obtain that plan in real-time. Information on which direction is better to find by RL is given through long-term (not instant) communication. The direction is given by a state compression mapping. This is therefore a Lamarckian type GA that inherits acquired knowledge from RL. By using a seesaw balancing problem as a test bed, the performance of the proposed method is shown.","","0-7803-2902","10.1109/ICEC.1996.542389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=542389","","Learning;Control systems;Multiagent systems;Communication system control;Delay effects;Mobile robots;Power generation;Delay lines;Mobile communication;Traffic control","learning (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;cooperative systems;software agents;knowledge based systems;planning (artificial intelligence);intelligent control;knowledge acquisition","reinforcement learning;coordinated control rules;multi-agent system;maximised global objective function;real-time synchronous communication;limited information exchange;on-line local optimisation;asynchronous global combinatorial optimisation;genetic algorithms;searching;coordinated plan;long-term communication;state compression mapping;Lamarckian type genetic algorithm;acquired knowledge inheritance;seesaw balancing problem","","2","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Virtual Test Bed (VTB) provides a computational environment that allows rapid modeling, simulation and virtual-prototyping of such complex systems. The VTB is also endowed with mechanisms to import models, and to co-simulate with other standard software packages. In this paper, a representative satellite electrical power system is virtually prototyped in VTB to demonstrate: (1) modeling of interdisciplinary devices such as solar array and battery system, and other power devices such as power converters; (2) cosimulation using MatLab/Simulink models for battery charge/discharge controller, and protection circuits; and (3) virtual-prototyping and simulation of the system to optimize performance.

Reconstitution of carrier phase by a Costas loop to coherently demodulate the PSK data and also the delay-lock error voltage has typically been the practice in PN modems intended for ground applications. To accommodate the platform dynamics, the Costas loop must have a relatively wide bandwidth, and this implies a significant threshold degradation. An alternate implementation employs a noncoherent carrier tracking loop which maintains frequency lock rather than phase lock. Now, the delay-lock error voltage is noncoherently demodulated. For the airborne application, analysis and simulations show this implementation will extend the receiver's tracking threshold significantly (up to 6 dB) for the worst case dynamics profile. An experimental project was undertaken to modify an existing ground PN modem (AN/USC-28, ADM version) for flight test. A software implementation of the digital tracking algorithms was selected where a HP-2100A minicomputer controls carrier frequency and PN code phase via digital phase shifters. The Costas demodulator for extracting PSK data resides entirely in software, and is completely segregated from PN tracking. In laboratory testing of the receiver with simulated dynamics and in actual flight tests, the demonstrated performance was found to approach closely the goals established by the analyses and simulations.","0090-6778;1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOM.1977.1093904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1093904","","Spread spectrum communication;Modems;Analytical models;Testing;Phase shift keying;Delay;Voltage;Aerospace simulation;Aircraft;Satellite communication","","Aircraft communications;Costas loops;Doppler effect;PSK modulation/demodulation;Pseudonoise-coded communication;Satellite communication, multiaccess","","25","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A widespread approach is to model the target architecture in a dedicated architecture description language (ADL) and to generate the tools automatically from the ADL specification. For C compiler generation, however, most existing systems are limited either by the manual retargeting effort or by redundancies in the ADL models that lead to potential inconsistencies. We present a new approach to retargetable compilation, based on the LISA 2.0 ADL with instruction semantics, that minimizes redundancies while simultaneously achieving a high degree of automation. The key of our approach is to generate the mapping rules needed in the compiler's code selector from the instruction semantics information.

In this paper, we unify these different problems as instances of the interchangeable pin routing (IPR) problem, which is NP-complete. By representing the solution space with flows in a triangulated routing network instead of grids, we developed a min-cost max-flow heuristic considering only the most important cuts in the design. The heuristic handles multiple layers, prerouted nets, and all-angle, octilinear or rectilinear wiring styles. Experiments show that the heuristic is very effective on most practical examples.

In this paper, we present a holistic model-based approach that overcomes these challenges and enables automatic recovery in distributed systems. To do so, it uses theoretically sound techniques including Bayesian estimation and Markov decision theory to provide controllers that choose good, if not optimal, recovery actions according to a user-defined optimization criteria. By combining monitoring and recovery, the approach realizes benefits that could not have been obtained by using them in isolation.

Todate there is only limited guidance on this subject, and in most cases detailed knowledge of the structure and properties of the problem is necessary for such guidance to be useable. For real world problems such knowledge may not be readily available. We describe an experimental approach to establish relationships between time to convergence and problem size of microgenetic algorithms (m-GAs). A discrete time dynamical traffic control problem with different sizes and levels of complexity was used as a test bed. The results showed that upon appropriately sizing the m-GA population, the m-GA can converge to a near-optimal solution in a number of generations equal to the string length. The results also demonstrate that with the selection of appropriate number of generations, it is possible to get most of the worth of the theoretically optimal solution but with only a fraction of the computation cost. The results showed that as the size of the optimization problem grew exponentially, the time requirements of m-GA grew only linearly thus making m-GAs especially suited for optimizing large scale and combinatorial problems for online optimization","","0-7695-1997","10.1109/ISUMA.2003.1236143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236143","","Traffic control;Computer aided software engineering;Large-scale systems;Communication system traffic control;Genetic algorithms;Intelligent transportation systems;Genetic engineering;Civil engineering;Testing;Cost function","computational complexity;convergence;genetic algorithms;traffic control","microgenetic algorithm;m-GA convergence;discrete time dynamical traffic control;optimal solution;optimization problem;combinatorial problem;online optimization","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This contrasts with typical traceability practices that tend to utilize a single technique such as a matrix or tool embedded into a requirements management package even though it may not provide the optimal solution for the traceability needs of a diverse set of requirements. The proposed solution, named TraCS (traceability for complex systems), defines project level trace strategies for categories of requirements and establishes links strategically in order to optimize returns of the traceability effort and minimize the risk inherent to software evolution. The paper provides a rationale for heterogeneous traceability, describes an extensible traceability framework, and then defines the process for establishing project level trace strategies. It concludes with an example drawn from a system to control chemical reactions at a catalyst plant.","1090-705X","0-7695-2174","10.1109/ICRE.2004.1335680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335680","","Investments;Packaging;Costs;Information retrieval;Computer science;Information systems;Control systems;Chemicals;Software engineering;Software testing","systems analysis;large-scale systems;risk management;investment","return-on-investment;requirements traceability;best-of-breed approach;traceability practices;requirements management package;TraCS;complex system traceability;software evolution","","20","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is assumed that the robots are located arbitrary at known starting positions and need to be moved to target positions in a known multi-obstacle three-dimensional environment. The factors considered for finding optimum paths for the group of mobile robots are the size and location of obstacles in the environment and the elevations of the environment. The developed software was tested on an aerial picture taken by a satellite imaging device for an outdoor environment. The size of obstacles, elevations present in the environment and starting positions of the robots and target position are all identified on the digital image in a form of grid map. The genetic algorithm takes information about the environment from the grid map, the results of processed pictures, and searches for optimum paths to move a group of mobile robots to specified targets.

Consequently, power quality has emerged as an issue of significant importance in the operation of these systems. In this paper, we address three issues of power quality: real-time detection and diagnosis of power quality problems, reliability and availability evaluation, and capacity margin analysis. The objective of real-time detection and diagnosis is to provide a seamless on-line monitoring and off-line maintenance process. The techniques are being applied to monitor the power quality of a few facilities at the University of Connecticut. Reliability analysis, based on a computationally efficient sum of disjoint products, enables analysts to decide on the optimum levels of redundancy, aids operators in prioritizing the maintenance options within a given budget, and in monitoring the system for capacity margin. Capacity margin analysis helps operators to plan for additional loads and to schedule repair/replacement activities. The resulting analytical and software tool is demonstrated on a sample data center.","1080-7225","0-7803-7094","10.1109/AUTEST.2001.949035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949035","","Power system reliability;Power quality;Monitoring;Availability;Maintenance;Power system analysis computing;Communication switching;Energy consumption;Costs;Data processing","power system reliability;maintenance engineering;condition monitoring;scheduling;redundancy;power system measurement;power system analysis computing;software tools;computerised monitoring","integrated reliability analysis;diagnostics;prognostics;integrated reliability analysis/diagnostics/prognostics;critical power systems;data centers;communication switching facilities;availability requirements;downtime;data center;electricity consumption;downtime cost;momentary interruption;data processing loss;power quality;system operation;real-time detection;real-time diagnosis;power quality problems;reliability evaluation;availability evaluation;capacity margin analysis;on-line monitoring;off-line maintenance process;reliability analysis;computationally efficient disjoint product sum;redundancy;maintenance option priorities;maintenance budget;capacity margin;monitoring;repair/replacement scheduling;software tool","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interoperability extensions made to two MPLs, MPI and Prowess, are described with a hybrid environment of both ATM and TCP-based legacy network technology. The native ATM API is described in this paper which supports cluster based computing that may be geographically distributed. Furthermore, this API provides a reliable transport interface to the MPL which has been optimized for an ATM environment.

A power management problem is formulated for the first time using closed-loop control concepts. We introduce an estimator and a controller that implement our power management methodology. The estimator is capable of very fast and accurate tracking of changes in the system parameters. Parameters estimated are used to form the system model. Our system model combines node and network centric power management decisions. Node centric power management assumes no a priori knowledge of requests coming in from outside the core. Thus, it implements a more traditional dynamic voltage scaling and power management control algorithms. Network-centric power management utilizes interaction with the other system cores regarding the power and the quality of service (QoS) needs. The overall system model is based on Renewal theory and, thus, guarantees globally optimal results. We introduce a fast optimization method that runs multiple orders of magnitude faster than the previous optimization approaches while still having the same accuracy in obtaining the power management control. Finally, our controller implements the results of optimization in either hardware or software. The new methodology for power management of NOCs is tested on a system consisting of four satellite units, each implementing an estimator and a controller capable of both node and network centric power management. Our results show large savings in power with good QoS.","1063-8210;1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.820533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263561","","Energy management;Energy consumption;Network-on-a-chip;Power system management;Power system modeling;Quality of service;Optimization methods;Parameter estimation;Knowledge management;Dynamic voltage scaling","power consumption;optimisation;stochastic processes;power control;system-on-chip;closed loop systems","power consumption management;NOC;networks-on-chip;node centric power management;network centric power management;closed loop control;estimator;controller;dynamic voltage scaling;power management control algorithms;QoS;quality of service;optimization;satellite units","","30","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, ELVIS requires significantly less hardware capacity than previous approaches. The design is easily scaled; it requires hardware that grows linearly with formula size. As such, it is the first to guarantee polynomial space and time complexity of formula loading. This avoids the laborious (NP-hard) placement and routing of each formula that has plagued previous approaches. The new approach can efficiently support dynamic clause addition, formula partitioning, implication heuristics and an unbounded number of variables per clause. Large scale implementation of these optimizations and modifying ELVIS to realize a multi-chip board design are the goals of future research.","","0-7695-0871","10.1109/FPGA.2000.903388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903388","","Programmable logic devices;Routing;Hardware;Computer science;Application software;Timing;Logic devices;Logic testing;Minimization;Test pattern generators","computability;programmable logic devices;parallel architectures","scalable loadable custom programmable logic device;Boolean satisfiability problems;ELVIS;custom PLD;timing verification;automated layout;logic minimization;test pattern generation;massively parallel SAT-solver;online clause addition;time complexity;space complexity;formula loading;dynamic clause addition;formula partitioning;implication heuristics;multi-chip board design","","6","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A deformation map is defined as a linear combination of basis functions of the discrete cosine transform. The coefficients of this combination are the parameters of the transformation. They are optimized to minimize a cost function which represents the distance between the reference and the deformed volume. A multi-parameters and multi-resolutions scheme, combined with a conjugate gradient method, completes the optimization. A fast discrete cosine transform is used for efficient computations of the cost function and its gradient.

While traditional approaches to linearizing the problem perform well when only a few tasks communicate, they have considerable difficulty solving problems involving a large number of intercommunicating tasks. This paper introduces new mixed integer formulations for three variations of the task allocation problem.

The gas extraction occurs in an automated ultra-high-vacuum system designed and fabricated at WHOI. The noble gases of interest are extracted in vacuo by crushing or high temperature fusion, separated using a cryogenic charcoal trap (operated between 70 and 3000 K), and delivered to a Mass Analyzer Products 215-50 mass spectrometer for measurement of isotopic composition. The system is controlled by a PC running under the Windows NT operating system. The software, largely written in Visual Basic and developed at WHOI, provides for synchronization of the extraction process with the mass spectrometer measurements. The extraction line control software is written so that the user can easily modify and customize the procedures, and allows automated operation. The extraction line software also provides a test scheduler, with building blocks which allow control of the system hardware by the computer without programming for modification and extension of the system by the operators. Software on a second PC controls the operation of the mass spectrometer over an IEEE-488 (GPIB) bus. This code was modified at WHOI to provide for the synchronization of the mass spectrometer with the extraction line and to optimize the determination of the measured gas concentrations. The system is primarily used to make helium and neon isotope measurements, in full 24 hour automation mode, but has also been designed and tested for Ar and Xe isotopes. This system is devoted to the measurement of both mantle and cosmic-ray-produced noble gas isotopes.","","0-7803-6551","10.1109/OCEANS.2000.881244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881244","","Automation;Mass spectroscopy;Isotopes;Sea measurements;Automatic control;Control systems;System testing;Minerals;Gases;Ocean temperature","geophysical equipment;geochemistry;isotope relative abundance;mass spectroscopic chemical analysis;inert gases;oceanographic equipment","geophysical equipment;geochemistry;isotope ratio;mass spectroscopy;chemical analysis;automation;rock;mass spectrometer;extraction line;noble gas;inert gas;mineral sample;Isotope Geochemistry Facility;Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution;WHOI;gas extraction;isotopic composition;test scheduler;ocean","","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach reduces the application developer's input/output optimization effort by isolating input/output optimization decisions within a retargetable file system infrastructure. To validate these claims, they have built a lightweight file system policy testbed that uses a trained learning mechanism to recognize access patterns. The file system then uses these access pattern classifications to select appropriate caching strategies, dynamically adapting file system policies to changing input/output demands throughout application execution.

Inexpensive technique that is applicable to a very large variety of clinical situations. In addition to expected antagonism from older technologies, there are three major reasons for this. First, in spite of offering quantitative information, most thermological tests have remained qualitative and subjective. Second, it has not been fully realized that abnormal thermal behavior, depicted in thermal imaging, often represents a physiological rather than an anatomical dysfunction. Most of the diagnostic information exists, therefore, in the time domain, rather than in the spatial distribution of temperature. A dynamic approach is needed, therefore, to study thermoregulatory dysfunction. Third, relatively little attention was given to mechanisms of physiological dysfunctions that manifest thermal abnormalities. Once these shortcomings are realized, thermological testing can be substantially improved by optimizing the testing conditions, including the hardware and software used. These points are illustrated by examining the case of breast cancer hyperthermia. It is concluded that breast-cancer-induced hyperthermia involves a thermoregulatory dysfunction rather than hypermetabolism or hypervascularization. Consequently, breast cancer induced hyperthermia is expected to be associated with a characteristic dynamic thermal behavior. To make them more sensitive and specific, screening tests for breast cancer must be substantially changed, including the equipment, the software and the interpretation of the thermal data. Following the same rationale, quantitative and dynamic telethermometry is expected to be extensively used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus, liver disease, arthritis, dermatology, neonatology, and neurological disorders. All of which involve thermoregulatory dysfunctions, in addition to open heart surgery, kidney transplant vascular and reconstructive surgery, where telethermometry provides real time information on perfusion or reperfusion.<<ETX>>","","0-7803-2050","10.1109/IEMBS.1994.412154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=412154","","Software testing;Breast cancer;Hyperthermia;Surgery;Humans;Skin;Temperature distribution;Hardware;Diabetes;Liver diseases","infrared imaging;hyperthermia;reviews;temperature measurement;skin","21st century thermology;biomedical technology future;defense oriented engineering;infrared telethermometry;human skin;diagnostic information;physiological dysfunctions mechanisms;breast cancer hyperthermia;hypermetabolism;hypervascularization;characteristic dynamic thermal behavior;screening tests;diabetes mellitus;liver disease;open heart surgery;kidney transplant surgery;telethermometry;real time information;perfusion;reperfusion;dermatology;arthritis","","2","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilize recent results in graph matching theory as mathematical foundations. We introduce a new type of problem which we call the optimal patch or optimal update problem: given an FSM M modeling the behavior of an existing system and an other machine M' modeling a new design, find an optimal patch, i.e., the edit operations changing M to M' that are minimal according to a given cost function associated with the edit operations. We analyze the complexity of the problem, and conclude that it is unlikely to have a polynomial time solution for it.

This increase in use makes server load heavier and leads to more system-bound queries due to newly sought emerging Web techniques, such as information discovery and reuse, mining and fusion. There is an obvious interest in assessing the consequences of this growth and understanding the system's behavior under varying conditions and workloads. The overall performance of the WWW is affected by various criteria in terms of clients, servers, and the network. Measuring performance of a computer system is a complex, difficult and important task. Time and rates are usually the basic measures of system performance. Having more realistic data about system performance will be necessary in the design and development of integrated information systems and systems for reuse. The main objective of this work is to measure the performance of various Web-based computer systems and Web servers using the SPEC Web99 benchmarking toolset. In the experiments that we carried out, the server is set up using freely available Apache server software run on a Sun Sparc-Ultra 80 machine, and six Windows-based clients that are used to load the server using the benchmark suite. First, the effects of varying resources, such as memory sizes and processors, on server's performance are measured and analyzed. Then, we tested and evaluated the effects of six different clients and workload parameters on the server configuration. Amongst the six experiments that were performed, two were set up in order to test the client-side. Some of the parameters varied were memory sizes, number of processors, the workload, and the benchmark parameters. Some interesting results were obtained while others were as expected.

Generating behaviors and using them to critique a specification is one effective approach. Up until now, symbolic evaluation has been the key technique of behavior generation. Unfortunately, it has drawbacks both in the amount of time it takes to complete a symbolic run, and in the large amount of uninteresting data it produces. The authors propose goal-directed envisionment as an alternative to symbolic evaluation, supplementing the basic envisioning techniques of qualitative physics with behavioral goals. This approach overcomes the problems of symbolic evaluation by generating interpretations in a reasonable amount of time and by exploiting goals to prioritize and analyze the interpretations. The authors describe and evaluate SC, an implemented system which employs goal-directed envisionment to critique specifications.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-2320","10.1109/IWSSD.1991.213080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=213080","","Automatic testing;Computer science;Physics;Interconnected systems;Buildings;Robustness;Feathers;Resource management;System testing;Storage automation","formal specification","specification criticism;complex system specification;symbolic evaluation;key technique;behavior generation;symbolic run;uninteresting data;goal-directed envisionment;basic envisioning techniques;qualitative physics;behavioral goals;SC;implemented system","","2","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the very small thickness of the top silicon layer a two step etching procedure using SECCO etching and bright field optical observations has been used to determine the dislocation density. A four step procedure which allows the transfer of the dislocation etch pits into the bulk was developed to increase the contrast between dislocation etch pits and the substrate.

CCNC 2004.","","2004","","","175","180","Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (MIPv6) is a proposal for handling the routing of IPv6 packets to mobile nodes in a foreign network. There are two methods for routing of IPv6 packets from the correspondent node (CN) to the mobile node (MN): triangular routing (TR) and route optimisation (RO). With MIPv6 RO, the CN uses the care-of address (CoA) as the destination address to transfer packets to the MN. Hence the MIPv6 module of the CN adds the mobility routing header (MRH) to store the home address of the MN. This increases packet sizes and may result in fragmentation. Fragmentation degrades transmission control protocol (TCP) performance over MIPv6. The paper discusses the cost of fragmentation and innovative fragmentation avoidance techniques. The cost of fragmentation is studied by carrying out experiments in a real IPv6 backbone (6Bone) where it is found that improved performance can be obtained by implementing innovative fragmentation avoidance techniques in the TCP/MIPv6 protocol stack of the Kame software. The efficiency of fragmentation avoidance techniques is also calculated. The paper also illustrates the impact of MIPv6 TR on TCP performance. A performance comparison between TR and RO is discussed. Based on this performance comparison, a generic adoptive routing technique is proposed.","","0-7803-8145","10.1109/CCNC.2004.1286854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286854","","Internet;IP networks;Educational institutions;Ethernet networks;Testing;Costs;Throughput;Routing protocols;Proposals;Optimization methods","telecommunication network routing;transport protocols;mobile computing;mobile radio;packet radio networks","Mobile IPv6;Mobile Internet Protocol version 6;MIPv6;TCP;fragmentation avoidance;adaptive routing;foreign network;correspondent node;mobile node;triangular routing;route optimisation;care-of address;destination address;mobility routing header;home address;transmission control protocol;protocol stack;Kame software","","1","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hot swapping enables a system to choose between various selected implementations of one task on-the-fly and thus to optimize the system's cost (e.g. power savings). The on-the-fly swapping between those implementations requires extra time to save and/or transform states of a certain task implementation. Even if the two steady-state schedules before and after the swapping are feasible, the transient schedule with the additional swapping computation time may exceed the system's capacity. Our technique is an extension to rate monotonic scheduling (RMS). While maintaining and meeting performance requirements, our technique shows an average reduction of 31% in power consumption compared to systems using a pure static scheduling approach (RMS) that cannot make use of task swapping. We have evaluated our algorithm through simulation of five real-world task sets and in addition by use of a large number of generated task sets.","1530-1591","0-7695-1471","10.1109/DATE.2002.998288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998288","","Runtime;Switches;Processor scheduling;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Hardware;Embedded software;National electric code;Cost function;Steady-state","processor scheduling;embedded systems;task analysis;computational complexity","dynamic runtime re-scheduling;multiple task implementations;platform-based designs;RMS scheduling technique;hot swapping;system implementations;system cost optimization;on-the-fly implementation swapping;power savings;task implementation states;steady-state schedules;swapping computation time;transient schedule;system capacity;rate monotonic scheduling extension;performance requirements;power consumption;pure static scheduling;task swapping;real-world task sets;generated task sets;embedded systems","","3","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sci., Hagenberg, Austria; NA; NA; NA","The First IEEE International Workshop Agumented Reality Toolkit,","","2002","","","2 pp.","","Many Augmented and Mixed Reality applications are based on two libraries: OpenGL is used for rendering and ARToolKit is used for marker recognition. The ARToolkit library is great for rapid prototyping of AR/MR applications. The library is very easy to use and it hides the complexity of marker recognition. In the AMIRE (Authoring Mixed Reality) project, a European founded AR project, we follow up the aim of ARToolKit consistently: the AMIRE approach is to offer well-established gems (software solutions) and components for a faster prototyping of AR/MR applications. Each content user should be able to develop his/her own AR/MR application without any computer graphics skills. Therefore, one of the primary goals of AMIRE is to find well-established solutions of current AR/MR applications. One of the solution is the ARToolKit library, which is used in numberless AR/MR applications. But which library should be used for rendering? Can we use a high-level graphics AN together with ARToolKit? Which graphic library would be the best for farther AR/MR applications? Should developers use Direct3D/OpenGL or should we propose a high-level graphics API, like Open Inventor, OpenGL Performer, OpenSG, or Open SceneGraph? High-level graphics APIs have a number of advantages as opposed to low-level graphics APIs. They include: A set of loaders (e.g. model and texture loaders); A scenegraph concept; Modern object oriented design; High performance (optimized rendering, view frustum culling, small object culling, Level of Detail nodes, etc.). One problem still remains: How difficult is the usage of ARToolKit, originally based on OpenGL, in combination with a high-level graphics API like OpenSG? For the AMIRE project we tested two different APIs: Open SO and Open SceneGraph.","","0-7803-7680","10.1109/ART.2002.1106978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106978","","Layout;Virtual reality;Application software;Software prototyping;Rendering (computer graphics);Prototypes;Software libraries;Computer graphics;Load modeling;Object oriented modeling","rendering (computer graphics);augmented reality;authoring systems","AMIRE;Authoring Mixed Reality;Augmented Reality;rendering;ARToolKit;marker recognition","","3","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An approximate beta probability density function of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the PCI method is derived. Using the theoretically derived formulas, it is shown that the PCI method requires much less data to produce a given, needed level of SNR with higher probability than the sample matrix inverse (SMI) method based on the inverse of the sample covariance matrix.

The baseline RASCAL UH-60 control system, as provided by the flight control contractor, was evaluated versus the ADS-33D handling-quality specifications. The selectable system gains were optimized to meet all system performance and handling-quality specifications. CONDUIT successfully exploited the tradeoff between forward loop and feedback dynamics to significantly improve the expected handling qualities and stability robustness, while reducing crossover frequency and minimizing actuator activity. The tradeoff studies showed the effect of increasing design margin (overdesign) on closed loop performance and actuator activity. Design margins exceeding 7.5% led to rapidly increasing actuator energy and saturation, resulting in shortened fatigue life of rotor control.","1066-033X;1941-000X","","10.1109/37.777786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=777786","","Aerospace control;Actuators;Control systems;Design optimization;Robust stability;Aircraft;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Libraries;Engines","aircraft control;control system CAD;control system analysis computing;software packages;aerospace computing;helicopters","multidisciplinary flight control development environment;CONDUIT;aircraft flight control design;graphical environment;simulation models;control law architectures;design specifications;analysis support;design guidance;multiobjective function optimization engine;CONSOL-OPTCAD;complex rotary-wing flight control problem;baseline RASCAL UH-60 control system;ADS-33D handling-quality specifications;forward loop;feedback dynamics;stability robustness;crossover frequency;design margin;closed loop performance;actuator activity;fatigue life;rotor control","","23","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A model which extends the logical aspects of this procedure to the case when multiple failures can occur is presented. The problem of applying the figure of merit used in the single error case is discussed briefly. It is pointed out that the extended model is capable of handling a more general class of tests than those usually considered.

A physics-of-failure based Defect Detection and Prevention (DDP) methodology previously developed has been integrated into a software tool and is currently being implemented on various NASA projects and as part of NASA's new model-based spacecraft development environment. The DDP methodology begins with prioritizing the risks (or failure modes, FMs) relevant to a mission which need to be addressed. These risks can be reduced through the implementation of a set of detection and prevention activities referred to herein as PACTs (preventative measures, analyses, process controls and tests). Each of these PACTs has some effectiveness against one or more FMs but also has an associated resource cost. The FMs can be weighted according to their likelihood of occurrence and their mission impact should they occur. The net effectiveness of various combinations of PACTs can then be evaluated against these weighted FMs to obtain the residual risk for each of these FMs and the associated resource costs to achieve these risk levels. The process thus identifies the project-relevant ""tall pole"" FMs and design drivers and allows real time tailoring with the evolution of the design and technology content. The DDP methodology allows risk management in its truest sense: it identifies and assesses risk, provides options and tools for risk decision making and mitigation and allows for real-time tracking of current risk status.","0149-144X","0-7803-5848","10.1109/RAMS.2000.816338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816338","","Physics;Failure analysis;Flexible manufacturing systems;NASA;Risk management;Costs;Aerospace engineering;Software tools;Space vehicles;Risk analysis","space vehicles;risk management;failure analysis","failure based analysis;hardware residual risks quantification;NASA Code Q;risk management processes;spaceflight projects;physics-of-failure;Defect Detection and Prevention methodology;software tool;model-based spacecraft development environment;risks prioritisation;failure modes;prevention activities;resource cost;mission impact;risk management;risk decision making","","1","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A subspace in the formation is taken as an importance region and a one-group importance generator is used in conjunction with the current McLDL code. The splitting of a photon only occurs within the important subspace, and direction biasing and the exponential transform are applied to drive photons into that region or the detector. The approach has been tested on a theoretical benchmark problem and the Atlas Wireline Services' commercial gamma-gamma lithodensity logging tool.

In this paper, we propose a new and practical resource reservation and scheduling algorithm for learning on demand based on satellite and ground IP network (RODS for short). In RODS, users provide a request for resources to the server station via ground Internet, then RODS employs the improved maximal queue length (IMQL) algorithm to schedule reservation requests and then generate an optimized sending scheme of multimedia courseware. RODS sends the corresponding resources to remote sites via satellite transmission.

Design verification is one of the main tasks in the design flow, aiming to certify the system functionality has been accomplished accordingly to the specification. A simulation based technique known as functional verification has been followed by the industry. In recent years, several articles in functional verification have been presented, focusing either on specific design verification experiments or on methods to improve and accelerate coverage reaching. In the first category, the majority of the papers are aimed to processors verification, while communication systems experiences were not such commonly reported. In the second category, different authors have proposed methodologies, which need an extensive and complex work by the verification engineer on tuning the acceleration algorithms to the specific design. In the present paper, we present a functional verification methodology applied to a Bluetooth Baseband adaptor core, described in SystemC RTL. Two techniques are considered, one following the traditional framework of applying random stimuli and checking functional coverage aspects; in the second one, a simple acceleration procedure, based on redundant stimuli filtering, is included. For both solutions, a hierarchical approach is adopted. We present several results comparing both solutions, showing the gain obtained in using the acceleration technique. Additionally, we show how results on a real testbench application environment correlate to the hierarchical verification approach taken.","","1-59593-161","10.1145/1084834.1084914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4076358","coverage analysis;functional verification;hierarchical verification;optimization;verification strategy","Testing;Bluetooth;Baseband;Acceleration;Continuous improvement;Design methodology;Digital systems;Design engineering;Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering","","","","3","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mazes may contain aliasing cells, i.e. squares in a different location that look identical to an agent with limited perceptive power. Mazes with aliasing squares present a particular difficult learning problem. As a possible approach to the problem, AgentP, a learning classifier system with associative perception, was recently introduced. AgentP is based on the psychological model of associative perception learning and operates explicitly imprinted images of the environment states. Two types of learning mode are described: the first, self-adjusting AgentP, is more flexible and adapts rapidly to changing information; the second, gradual AgentP, is more conservative in drawing conclusions and rigid when it comes to revising strategy. The performance of both systems is tested on existing and new aliasing environments. The results show that AgentP often outperforms (and always at least matches) the performance of other techniques and, on the large majority of mazes used, learns optimal or near optimal solutions with fewer trials and a smaller classifier population.","1089-778X;1941-0026","0-7803-9363","10.1109/CEC.2005.1554826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554826","","Machine learning;Psychology;Legged locomotion;Animals;Service robots;Intelligent robots;Orbital robotics;Power system modeling;System testing;Navigation","pattern classification;learning systems;self-adjusting systems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;software agents","AgentP classifier system;self-adjusting system;learning classifier systems;self-organization;evolution;reinforcement learning;psychological model;associative perception learning","","","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conclusion drawn from this study is that a genetic algorithm approach is an efficient and effective approach for fingerprint image registration.","","0-7695-0559","10.1109/ASSET.2000.888069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888069","","Fingerprint recognition;Genetic algorithms;Image matching;Testing;Tellurium;Decision making;Neural networks;Graphics","fingerprint identification;image matching;image registration;genetic algorithms;performance evaluation","fingerprint image registration;genetic algorithms;automated fingerprint identification systems;image alignment;optimization;performance evaluation;2D algorithms;3D algorithms;experiment","","4","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Behave simulator is a multilevel simulator that can simulate circuits at several levels of abstraction-behavioral level, gate level, or a mixture. Zero delay and rank order capability are also available in Behave and can be used to advantage. For example, in a simulation of an array multiplier involving 10,000 vectors, the time decreased from 16 hours to 38 minutes, simply because the elements were rank ordered. This range of processing is possible because of the flexibility in software for general-purpose CPUs.","0740-7475;1558-1918","","10.1109/MDT.1987.295106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4069964","","Circuit simulation;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Logic design;Delay;Testing;Hardware;Central Processing Unit;Probability;Performance gain","","","","2","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An implementation, the fault invariant classifier, demonstrates the efficacy of the technique. The implementation uses dynamic invariant detection to generate program properties. It uses support vector machine and decision tree learning tools to classify those properties. In our experimental evaluation, the technique increases the relevance (the concentration of fault-revealing properties) by a factor of 50 on average for the C programs, and 4.8 for the Java programs.

Based on a fuzzy set theoretic foundation for representing imprecise requirements, we describe a systematic approach for analyzing the tradeoffs between conflicting requirements using the techniques in decision science. The systematic tradeoff analyses are used for three important tasks in the requirement engineering process: (1) for validating the structure used in aggregating prioritized requirements, (2) for identifying the structures and the parameters of the underlying representation of imprecise requirements and (3) for assessing the priorities of conflicting requirements.

Therein lies the focus of MPEG-4: the convergence of common applications of the above mentioned three industries. MPEG-4 aims to satisfy the new requirements and expectations, by providing an audio visual coding standard allowing for interactivity, high compression and universal accessibility. Moreover coding of video data is an important feature in digital industry and the MPEG-4 video encoder has to be able to encode efficiently visual information and probably in real time conditions. Therefore a lot of effort has been spent in real time video encoding and decoding issues using either hardware or software solutions. This paper addresses these issues by describing a parallel software implementation of the MPEG-4 video encoder using multithread techniques. A scheduling policy is proposed to guarantee via a buffer synchronisation a significant speed up which under some special circumstances reach an optimised load balancing solution. The proposed scheme is tested using the hardware resources of Unix multiprocessor hardware platform (running Solaris 2.0) by rewriting and modifying the current MPEG-4 encoder.","","0-8186-8557","10.1109/MMCS.1998.693641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=693641","","Concurrent computing;MPEG 4 Standard;Video compression;Hardware;Telecommunication computing;TV;Communication industry;Computer industry;Convergence;Application software","video coding;code standards;telecommunication standards;multimedia systems;data compression;real-time systems;scheduling;synchronisation;resource allocation;multiprocessing systems","concurrency;MPEG-4 video encoder;audio visual coding standard;video compression;universal accessibility;real time video encoding;decoding;parallel software;multithread techniques;scheduling;buffer synchronisation;load balancing;Unix;multiprocessor;Solaris 2.0","","4","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The type of search undertaken by the groups appears to be a form of adaptive, rather than enumerative, search. Recently, efforts have been made to incorporate this adaptation into an analytical model of GDSS usage. One possible method for incorporating adaptation into an analytical model is to use an evolutionary algorithm, such as a genetic algorithm (GA), as an analogy for the group problem-solving process. In this paper, a test is made to determine whether GDSS behaves similarly to a GA process utilizing rank selection, uniform crossover, and uniform mutation operators. A Markov model for GAs is used to make this determination. Using GDSS experimental data, the best-fit transition probabilities are estimated and various hypotheses regarding the relation of GA parameters to GDSS functionality are proposed and tested.

However, one of the handicaps of coordinated checkpointing is the high latency for committing output from the application to the external world. Enhancing the checkpointing scheme, with a message logging protocol is a good solution to reduce the output latency. The idea is to track the sources of non-determinism in order to replay the application in a reproducible way during rollback recovery. We present a new event logging scheme that only logs those messages that may be delivered non deterministically to the application. While other schemes keep track of the arrival order of all the messages we just save the delivery order of some of them. Our scheme exploits the semantics of message passing and is able to reduce considerably the number of receiving events when compared with other existing schemes. We present some performance results that compare the output latency of coordinated checkpointing, pessimistic message logging, optimistic message logging and our event logging scheme.","","0-7695-0001","10.1109/HICSS.1999.772986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=772986","","Checkpointing;Printers;Protocols;Humans;Data visualization;Writing","software fault tolerance;program testing;system recovery;message passing","message semantics;fast-output commit;checkpointing-and-rollback recovery;long running applications;failures;coordinated checkpointing;checkpointing scheme;message logging protocol;output latency;non determinism;event logging scheme;arrival order;delivery order;message passing;receiving events;pessimistic message logging;optimistic message logging","","1","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One way of controlling the smoothing is to introduce, during the reconstruction process, a prior knowledge about the slice anatomy. In a previous work, we showed using numerical observers that anatomical priors can improve lesion detection accuracy in simulated Ga-67 images of the chest. The goal of this work is to expand and enhance our previous investigations by conducting human-observer localization receiver observer characteristics (LROC) studies and to compare the results to those of a multiclass channelized non-prewhitening (CNPW) model observer. Phantom images were created using the SIMIND Monte Carlo simulation software from the MCAT phantom. The lesion: background contrast was 27.5:1. The anatomical data employed were the structure boundaries from the original, noise-free slices of the MCAT phantom. Images were reconstructed using the DePierro MAP algorithm with surrogate functions. Images were also reconstructed with no priors using the RBI-EM algorithm, with 4 iterations and 4 projections per subset Two weights (0.005 and 0.04) for the prior were tested. The following reconstruction scheme was used to reach convergence for the anatomical priors: The 120 projections were reconstructed successively with 4, 8, 24, 60, and 120 projections per subset with 1, 1, 1, 1, and finally 50 iterations respectively; the result of each reconstruction was used as an initial estimate for the next reconstruction.

The control strategy considered in this study is a two-level hierarchy. The proposed two-level structure results from the decomposition of the overall problem into parallel subproblems. This allows the retention of the closed-loop controls associated with each subsystem, which together constitute the lower level (Level I). The central coordinating controller forms the upper level (Level II). The coordination of the local controllers by the central controller accounts for nonlinear terms and interconnections and yields the global optimization of the overall system transient performance. The local controllers are not dependent on one another and are robust to any changes in the network configuration, due to the feedback or closed-loop control formulation inherent in the proposed strategy. To ensure physical realizability of the local controllers, the input was restricted to locally measurable signals. The methodology was implemented in a prototype software program, which was tested on a single machine connected to a very large network approximated by an infinite bus, and then on the IEEE four-generator test system. These studies considered fault-clearing times greater than the critical, assuring an unstable condition. The well-damped optimal state and control trajectories illustrate the successful solution of the problem, indicating that the technique is a valuable tool dealing with transient control problems for large-scale systems.","0093-9994;1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.809440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189216","","Digital control;Power industry;Industrial control;Centralized control;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Software testing;System testing;Optimal control;Robust control","electricity supply industry;power system control;power system transient stability;control system synthesis;hierarchical systems;closed loop systems;optimal control;robust control;nonlinear control systems;feedback;digital control;control system analysis","electric utility industry;two-level hierarchy nonlinear digital controllers;control design;multiple dynamic-braking units;closed-loop controls;feedback;closed-loop control formulation;fault clearing times;well-damped optimal state trajectories;well-damped optimal control trajectories;large-scale systems;transient stability","","4","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Data prefetching solutions ranging from pure software approach by inserting prefetch instructions through program analysis to purely hardware mechanisms have been proposed. The degrees of success of those techniques are dependent on the nature of the applications. The need for innovative approach is rapidly growing with the introduction of applications such as object-oriented applications that show dynamically changing memory access behavior In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the use of data prefetchers that are trained off-line using smart learning algorithms to produce prediction models which captures hidden memory access patterns. Once built, those prediction models are loaded into a data prefetching unit in the CPU at the appropriate point during the runtime to drive the prefetching. On average by using table size of about 8KB size, we were able to achieve prediction accuracy of about 68% through our own proposed learning method and performance was boosted about 37% on average on the benchmarks we tested. Furthermore, we believe our proposed framework is amenable to other predictors and can be done as a phase of the profiling-optimizing-compiler.","1063-6404","0-7695-1700","10.1109/ICCD.2002.1106792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106792","","Prefetching;Application software;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Hardware;Prediction algorithms;Load modeling;Runtime;Accuracy;Learning systems","computer architecture;storage management;optimising compilers;Markov processes","data prefetching;prefetch instructions;hardware mechanisms;smart learning;prediction models;profiling-optimizing-compiler;Markovian predictors;off-line prediction tables;data cache;off-line trace analysis;microarchitecture","","3","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ADC 2000 (Cat. No.PR00528)","","2000","","","140","148","For many distributed data intensive applications, the default remote invocation of CORBA objects to a server is not acceptable because of performance degradation. Caching can improve performance and scalability of such applications by increasing the locality of data. This paper proposes a caching approach that optimises the default remote invocation behaviour of CORBA clients. Efficient fine-grained access to remote objects requires objects to be shipped to clients and cached across transaction boundaries. This approach is based on cache consistency via backward validation, generic approach for cache storage, object based data shipping and replication management. These features are introduced without changing the object definitions that the client may already depend upon. An implementation of the proposed caching approach is done on Orbix by extending the smart proxies. We also provide a test with different client workloads. The results demonstrated a significant performance increase, in terms of transactions per second.","","0-7695-0528","10.1109/ADC.2000.819825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819825","","Protocols;Electrical capacitance tomography;Delay;Bandwidth;Computer science;Australia;Application software;Testing;Sockets;Operating systems","cache storage;memory protocols;distributed object management;remote procedure calls;client-server systems;software performance evaluation;transaction processing;distributed databases;object-oriented databases","caching protocol;CORBA performance;distributed data intensive applications;default remote invocation;performance degradation;scalability;data locality;client server system;fine-grained access;transaction boundaries;cache consistency;backward validation;replication management;Orbix;smart proxies","","1","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.01CH37192)","","2001","","","265","270","The determination of the electrical contact area between two contact members is a recurrent problem which will probably never be solved exactly. In this paper, we present an original method which allows us to determine the approximate electrical contact area obtained when a branch of an elastic clip is pressed against a flat bar. This method is based on the measurement of the electric potential on the bar, on a U shaped contour located as close as possible to the clip. In the experimental set up, the contour potential V/sub m/(s) is quickly recorded, while the contact is fed by a stabilized current of /spl plusmn/30 A, to rule out thermal drifts and EMFs. The electrical potential is measured between the top of the clip and a metallic probe sliding on the contour, with a constant contact force. Assuming that the contact area is elliptic, the unknown parameters of the problem are the location of the ellipse and its main dimensions. The program used to determine these parameters couples a 2D finite element module with an optimization module of the MATLAB/sup (R)/ software. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary set of values for the parameters, uses the experimental boundary conditions and calculates the potential differences V/sub m/(s) corresponding to the experimental contour. Then the coupled ""optimization module and FEM module"" runs, changing the parameters, in order to make V/sub c/(s) as close as possible to V/sub m/(s). The various tests results of the methodology are very satisfactory.","","0-7803-6667","10.1109/HOLM.2001.953221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953221","","Inverse problems;Contacts;Electric variables measurement;Electric potential;Force measurement;Shape measurement;Probes;Finite element methods;MATLAB;Boundary conditions","contact potential;inverse problems;optimisation;finite element analysis;electrical contacts","inverse method;approximate electrical contact area;clip-to-bar contact;electrical contact area;contact members;elastic clip;flat bar;bar electric potential measurement;U shaped contour;contour potential;stabilized current contact feed;thermal drifts;EMFs;electrical potential;sliding metallic probe;constant contact force;elliptic contact area;ellipse location;2D finite element module;MATLAB optimization module;boundary conditions;potential differences;coupled optimization module/FEM module","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Grass","Electrostatic Precipitation Group, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","","2002","38","5","1190","1195","The power consumption of large precipitators can be in the range of 1 MW and above. Depending on the dust load properties, the electrical power may be reduced by up to 50% by applying fuzzy logic, without significantly increasing the dust emissions. The new approach uses fuzzy logic for optimization of existing electrostatic precipitators. The software runs on a standard personal computer platform under the Windows NT operating system. The controllers of the electrostatic precipitator power supplies are linked to the personal computer via an industrial network (e.g., PROFIBUS). The system determines online the differentials of emission versus electrical power of each field. This measurement is difficult because of overlaid events in the other zones, and process changes. The long response, time of the resultant dust emission due to electrical power changes in the precipitator is an additional complication. Rules were defined for a coarse, but fast-response power adaptation of all zones. Fine tuning the running system after the coarse optimization increased the accuracy and reliability. When installed on a 4/spl times/5 zone precipitator in a power station, significant results were obtained. The power savings over three months of operation were in the range of 40%-60% depending on the load and fuel characteristics. Data were recorded over the test period of three months.

The paper describes expert system-aided automated design, simulation and controller tuning of an AC motor drive system. It is an extension of earlier work that discussed the design and optimization of power converter systems. Based on the application and performance specifications from the user, the expert system selects a motor drive configuration consisting of the AC machine type, power converter and control topologies. The expert system embeds the design expertise of an experienced AC motor drive system designer to configure, design and fine-tune the AC motor drive system. Next, the expert system supervises an autonomous hybrid simulation where the controller software is fine-tuned in real-time before loading to an experimental AC motor drive system. The paper discusses the design methodology for AC motor drive systems, with particular emphasis on the configuration selection, AC motor sizing and control design and tuning. The expert system based control design is experimentally verified on an indirect vector controlled induction motor drive system with synchronous current control, using a 5 hp IGBT inverter, with the control implemented by a Texas Instruments DSP 320C25.

This problem called the static mapping problem (SMP) is known to be NP-hard, and has been tackled using heuristic solutions. The objective of this paper is to present the first reported learning automaton (LA) based solution to the SMP, generated by the close resemblance of the SMP to the equipartitioning problem. The LA in question is of the so-called fixed-structure family, solution to the equipartitioning problem is then modified to solve the SMP. Several algorithmic variants of this solution have been implemented, and these have all been rigorously tested and evaluated through extensive simulations on randomly generated parallel applications. The focus in this work is to demonstrate the applicability of LA to the SMP, not to optimise and evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that LA provides a promising tool that can effectively solve the mapping problem.","1530-2075","0-7695-2312","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420272","Static Mapping;Learning Automata;Task assignment;Parallel Computing","Learning automata;Stochastic processes;Application software;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Testing;Parallel processing;Bandwidth;Processor scheduling;Laboratories","learning automata;parallel machines;optimisation;stochastic automata;stochastic programming;scheduling","fixed-structure learning automaton;stochastic static mapping;NP-hard problem;heuristic solution;equipartitioning problem;parallel computing;task assignment","","10","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Disk drives must provide faster access times in order to optimize the speed of I/O operations. In a multitasking system with many processes, disk performance can be improved by incorporating a scheduling algorithm for maintaining several pending requests in the disk queue. This paper describes the development of a simulator which uses four disk scheduling algorithms to measure their performance in terms of total head movement. These algorithms are: FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SSTF (Shortest-Seek-Time-First), LOOK (Look-ahead) for both upward and downward directions, and C-LOOK (Circular LOOK). Five different types of test samples, containing from 8 to 50 request tracks, have been used to obtain simulation results. The developed simulator runs successfully in a multiprogramming environment and the tabulated results demonstrate that the LOOK (downward direction) algorithm provides the best results for given test samples due to the reduction of a large number of unnecessary head movements. As several wild swings are experienced by the FCFS scheme, it gives the worst scheduling performance. SSTF is much better compared to LOOK (upward direction) and C-LOOK. It has also been noticed that LOOK is more efficient than C-LOOK at all loads, whereas C-LOOK is better at high loads only, as it reduces the starvation problem. The performance of each algorithm, however, depends heavily on the number and type of requests.","","0-7803-6355","10.1109/TENCON.2000.888379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888379","","Scheduling algorithm;Disk drives;Computational modeling;Testing;Delay;Computer simulation;Processor scheduling;Educational institutions;Mechanical engineering;Telephony","hard discs;disc drives;scheduling;software performance evaluation;virtual machines;multiprogramming","simulation;performance comparison;disk scheduling algorithms;disk access times;I/O operation speed optimization;multitasking system;disk queue pending requests;head movement;FCFS algorithm;first-come, first-served;SSTF algorithm;shortest seek time first;LOOK algorithm;look-ahead;upward direction;downward direction;C-LOOK algorithm;circular LOOK;request tracks;multiprogramming environment;efficiency;load;starvation problem","","4","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper concludes that the benchmark represents an unbiased subset of actual scenarios because the ranking and performance patterns of the leading Web services frameworks used in the experiment are consistent with industry wide experiences. Additionally the paper introduces a performance model to analyze Web service frameworks and identifies complexity of the SOAP messages and size of the payloads they carry as two major factors that affect the RTT of the SOAP messages and reveals that a framework that is good at handling complex SOAP messages may not deal with messages that carry larger payloads equally well.","","0-7695-2408","10.1109/SCC.2005.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531259","","Web services;Simple object access protocol;Computer architecture;Service oriented architecture;Testing;Computer industry;Payloads;Grid computing;Space technology;Application software","Internet;communication complexity;protocols;benchmark testing","Web service framework;homogeneous data structure streaming;performance benchmark;real world business services;SOAP message complexity","","11","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TRAPPER comprises components for the design, mapping, visualization and optimization of parallel applications. One goal of this article is to motivate the requirements for a monitoring system in such a graphical programming environment. Because the existing monitoring system DELTA-T already fulfils a lot of these requirements we decided to integrate it. The result of this integration is shown in detail. The main features are automatic observation of software and hardware events at different granularity, different transport strategies of the monitoring data, and a flexible programmer interface to interact with the monitor. All features may be switched on and off by the graphical user interface of TRAPPER. Measurements show the low overhead of our implementation.

The goals of the approach are: 1) to enable pipelined evaluation, 2) to avoid producing duplicate (intermediate) result nodes, 3) to visit as few document nodes as possible, and 4) to avoid visiting nodes more than once.

Touch","Cinesite Digital Studios, USA; NA; NA","Computer","","1998","31","11","46","52","In networking today, host workstations are increasingly being used as routers. Host based routers offer a number of advantages, but they suffer from inefficient support for high bandwidth interfaces. The authors' work has focused on the technology's major drawback its inefficiency in supporting high bandwidth interfaces. Their approach is to optimize packet processing by applying techniques that transfer packets directly among host interfaces, thus removing an extra data copy. This technique increases data throughput by 45 percent while reducing the host's CPU load. They found that peer DMA forwarding can increase host based router throughput by up to 45 percent, supporting bandwidths of 480 Mbps. Peer DMA host based forwarding requires network interface cards with substantial shared memory resources, because packet queues are stored on the interfaces themselves, rather than in host RAM. The queuing algorithm remains in the host CPU, supporting advanced queue management. Current systems have limited packet processing. A combination of streamlined forwarding algorithms and aggregate interrupt processing should further increase host based capability. Moving some of the IP processing out to the NIC coprocessor may enable this. It is also apparent that as processor speeds increase, the advantages of peer DMA will aid throughput for small packet sizes.","0018-9162;1558-0814","","10.1109/2.730736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=730736","","Read-write memory;Network interfaces;Memory management;Random access memory;Workstations;Production;Collaborative software;Software systems;Routing;Software testing","network interfaces;packet switching;queueing theory;performance evaluation;shared memory systems","high speed data paths;host based routers;networking;host workstations;high bandwidth interfaces;packet processing;data copy;peer DMA forwarding;host based router throughput;peer DMA host based forwarding;network interface cards;shared memory resources;packet queues;queuing algorithm;advanced queue management;streamlined forwarding algorithms;aggregate interrupt processing;host based capability;IP processing;NIC coprocessor;processor speeds","","3","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The increasing complexity of modern systems, combined with reduced development times, makes the production of fault-free systems extremely difficult. Minimising the effects of such faults is a challenging task. Developing a self-repair capability for electronic systems would provide a means to alleviate the effects of a fault. This approach, inspired by healing in biological systems, offers the capability of repairing faults without user intervention. This paper describes a design methodology targeted at self-repairing systems based on modelling systems using the unified modelling language (UML). The approach increases the flexibility of systems by enabling the transfer of functionality between hardware and software. The system configuration is produced by an intelligent reasoning approach, capable of producing optimised configurations at the design stage, or to repair a fault. This design methodology is demonstrated on an example system and the challenges this presents are discussed.","1462-5970","","10.1049/ip-sen:20020793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167721","","","automatic testing;circuit CAD;fault tolerance;inference mechanisms","Unified Modelling Language;UML;electronic systems;functional repair;circuit CAD;self-repairing systems;functionality transfer;intelligent reasoning;fault tolerance","","","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Based on the modelling results several flat-bed travelling wave panels with stripe and cylindrical electrodes were constructed and tested. The separation characteristics of the panels were assessed by examining the direction of transport of a two powder mixture with different size distributions for the frequencies of AC potential up to 300 Hz. It was discovered that for the majority of panels successful powder separation could be achieved for two frequency bands. The position of the bands depended mainly on electrode geometry (i.e. pitch and width).

The agency is optimistic that its modernization plan and efforts to implement a program called Free Flight will go a long way toward solving the problem. Simply put, Free Flight opens the skies to air traffic, removing many of the enforced air routes that planes were required to follow. The program calls for air traffic controllers to continue to supervise flight operations and monitor safety measures. But air traffic controllers, still using equipment that is decades old and breaks down frequently, are wary of FAA promises. Planned software upgrades are being installed to improve air traffic control systems. Upgrades in about half of the 20 en route centers in the United States, which handle aircraft at higher, cruising altitudes, have gone pretty smoothly, but there have been some mishaps. What will help the situation, and is already being tested in limited circumstances in certain air traffic facilities as prototypes, is better technology that will give controllers more reliable displays, computer systems, decision-support tools, and data-all goals of Free Flight, or at least of Phase I of the program.","0018-9235;1939-9340","","10.1109/6.901154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901154","","Air traffic control;FAA;Computer displays;Delay;Shape;Monitoring;Air safety;Aerospace safety;Aircraft;System testing","air traffic control;aerospace computing","Free Flight;air traffic control;air traffic controllers;flight operations supervision;safety measures monitoring;software upgrades;air traffic facilities;decision-support tools;reliable displays;computer systems","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose it had a short (40ns) oil insulated Blumlein, which originally fed a resistive load. After Mogul E was completed, E Minor was converted into a flash X-Ray machine using an existing, surplus insulator stack from another machine on site (EROS). Unfortunately this insulator stack is only capable of holding off 5.5MV, well below the maximum possible output of the E-Minor Marx. To continue the X-ray diode development work required for the proposed Hydrodynamics Research Facility (HRF), E Minor needs to be upgraded so that it can deliver a 10MV pulse. E Minor will be upgraded to full voltage operation by fitting a Mogul-E-style insulator stack, requiring modifications to the front end of the machine and to the building in which it is housed. 2d electrostatic modelling software has been used to design the new front end the machine.

It enables very good prediction performance of the very important harmonic and intermodulation characteristics of these devices when used in typical /spl mu/-wave switching applications. Accurate harmonic distortion measurements have been performed on a number of commercial surface mount PIN diodes, over a wide range of relevant bias conditions and RF power levels. Parasitic elements are first extracted from microwave S-parameter data. Separate non-linear circuit models are then used for the ON and OFF states of the PIN diodes, and these are directly optimized on the measured harmonic distortion data using a dedicated modeling platform developed within a commercial modeling software tool. The new models have been implemented and tested in a popular harmonic balance circuit simulator with very good results. The modeling solution described here can be also applied to other active devices for similar large-signal modeling problems.","0149-645X","0-7803-7695","10.1109/MWSYM.2003.1212458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212458","","Switches;Intermodulation distortion;Circuit simulation;Harmonic distortion;Distortion measurement;Circuit testing;Power measurement;Performance evaluation;Radio frequency;Data mining","p-i-n diodes;semiconductor device models;intermodulation distortion;harmonic distortion;surface mount technology;microwave diodes;semiconductor switches;microwave switches;circuit simulation;nonlinear network analysis;S-parameters;equivalent circuits;semiconductor device measurement","nonlinear modeling;IMD;/spl mu/-wave PIN diodes;harmonic balance circuit simulators;harmonic characteristics;intermodulation characteristics;/spl mu/-wave switching applications;harmonic distortion measurements;surface mount PIN diodes;bias conditions;RF power levels;parasitic elements;microwave S-parameter data;nonlinear circuit models;dedicated modeling platform;commercial modeling software tool;active devices","","1","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design-based mission operation has been a major part of the research effort in order to establish system-wide as well as lifecycle-wide impact analysis as an integral part of the mission design process. The design-based mission operation is approached by implementing Virtual Mission Lifecycle (VML), modeling and simulation tools and system engineering processes for building a virtual mission system that can perform a realistic mission operation during the design phase of a mission. As in the real mission lifecycle convention, the VML is composed of design, development, integration and test, and operation phases.

Evaluating tactics at sea requires a considerable amount of forward planning and ties up valuable and expensive assets. It is therefore important that the candidate tactics must be developed to a sufficient level of maturity on-shore. This is done through a combination of individual brainpower, paper studies and computer simulation. The computer simulation must be inexpensive, totally flexible, sufficiently accurate, reliable and above all easily available to, and usable by, the individual tactical desk officers. Any simulations developed need to be easily adaptable. Tactical development is not a formally structured process; software development is not easy when there are no formal requirements. The MWC have investigated using the Spreadsheet Excel to form the basis of such simulations.

Most of the experimental parameter estimations yielded tight ranges of kinetic values for both gene networks. However, the results using simulated data indicate that the algorithm was able to provide better parameter estimates for the pulse generating network than for the transcriptional cascade. This is likely a result of the larger amount of time-series data available for the pulse generator and its greater level of phenotypical complexity, leading to tighter constraints for optimization. The variation in the magnitudes of the standard deviations between parameter estimates may give an indication of system sensitivity to specific kinetic rate constants.

Virtual reality is becoming increasingly popular as a tool for interacting with data and steering the optimization process, rather than simply displaying results. Constantly evolving haptic technology allows people to directly interact with digital objects and data as they do in the real world using their sense of touch., Haptics is revolutionizing the way engineers interact with computers. Hitherto, designers and artists have used haptics to intuitively sculpt models using digital clay and doctors have trained on haptics based virtual surgical simulators Most applications however merely seek to make up for the lack of sense of touch and its effects. The current work investigates the application of the haptics loop for decision support activities in core engineering areas like design optimization and shop floor layout. The simulated annealing algorithm with an adaptive cooling schedule is used to solve the quadratic assignment problem for facility layout The results obtained are interpreted and tested using a combined haptic and graphic environment. The value added due to haptics in virtual reality environments is an open problem. Human factor experiments for a decision-making environment were conducted to measure the value added due to inclusion of haptics. After a comprehensive series of tests, a decision is made with regards to use of haptics for engineering and scientific applications.","","0-7695-1402","10.1109/VSMM.2001.969759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969759","","Haptic interfaces;Virtual reality;Application software;Layout;Testing;Cognition;Data engineering;Surgery;Computational modeling;Design engineering","virtual reality;simulated annealing;quadratic programming;haptic interfaces","haptic framework;quantitative design analysis;virtual environment;cognition;algorithm performance;virtual reality;decision support activities;design optimization;shop floor layout;simulated annealing algorithm;human factor;decision-making environment;quadratic assignment problem","","1","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the more useful applications of scenarios is generating user requirements for information systems. For this application several scenarios could be generated-showing pessimistic, optimistic, and most likely cases-in order to develop the requirements that are common to all cases, so that a system can be designed for a ""surprise-free"" future. However, preparing scenarios is often too laborious to allow for more than one or two scenarios to be generated. As well, it is very difficult to ensure that the scenarios are consistent and coherent. This paper describes the SaGa (Scenario Generator) computer-based tool that easily generates a number of scenarios containing a coherent set of factors.

This statement may seem over-optimistic, not to say pretentious and unverifiable. After all, can we compare architectures? can we set up benchmarks? or can we measure how good an architecture is compared to another? An architecture defines organization principles, integration methods and supporting tools. Comparing those tools, methods and principles may sometime end up in sterile controversies. However, we think there are means to measure the overall quality (or interest) of an architecture. Development time is for example one relevant criterion. Basically, using a specific architecture, how long does it take to integrate a complete demonstration, including nontrivial decisional capabilities, from the low level functional modules up to the supervisory level? This may seem a rather weak measure of architecture quality; however, it encompasses properties such as genericity and adaptability, ease of design and programming, extensibility and robustness. In this paper we describe our recent experience in integrating a complete demonstration from scratch in 40 days using the LAAS architecture.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844044","","Robot control;Robustness;Navigation;Buildings;Motion control;Testing;Mobile robots;Laboratories;Artificial intelligence;Software tools","mobile robots;computerised navigation;software architecture;robot programming","LAAS architecture;mobile robot control;organization principles;integration methods;supporting tools;development time;nontrivial decisional capabilities;genericity;adaptability;extensibility;robustness;indoor robot navigation","","9","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose novel techniques to improve further the temporal prediction at the enhancement layer so that coding efficiency is superior to the existing FGS. Our approach utilizes two parameters, the number of bitplanes, /spl beta/ (0/spl les//spl beta//spl les/maximal number of bitplanes), and the amount of predictive leak, /spl alpha/ (0/spl les//spl alpha//spl les/1), to control the construction of the reference frame at the enhancement layer. Parameters /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ can be selected for each frame to provide tradeoffs between coding efficiency and error drift. Our approach offers a general and flexible framework that allows further optimization. It also includes several well-known motion-compensated FGS techniques as special cases with particular sets of /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/. We analyze the theoretical advantages when /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ are used, and provide an adaptive technique to select /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/, which yields an improved performance as compared to that of fixed parameters. An identical technique is applied to the base layer for further improvement. Our experimental results show over 4 dB improvements in coding efficiency using the MPEG-4 testing conditions. Removal of error propagation is demonstrated with several typical channel transmission scenarios.","1051-8215;1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2002.800314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1013846","","Robustness;Scalability;MPEG 4 Standard;Streaming media;Video compression;Internet;Multimedia communication;Computer errors;Application software;Decoding","video coding;prediction theory;optimisation;motion compensation;visual communication;mobile radio;Internet;multimedia communication","fine granularity scalability;trellis-based predictive leak;MPEG-4;streaming video tool;enhancement layer;coding efficiency;bitplanes;error drift;optimization;motion compensation;adaptive technique;base layer;error propagation;mobile device;wireless channels;Internet;multimedia communications","","50","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm maps genes in a known pathway to their homologous genes (if any) in a target genome that is most consistent with (a) predicted orthologous gene relationship, (b) predicted operon structures, and (c) predicted co-regulation relationship of operons. Mathematically, we have formulated this problem as a constrained minimum spanning tree problem (called a Steiner network problem), and demonstrated that this formulation has the desired property through applications. We have solved this mapping problem using a combinatorial optimization algorithm, with guaranteed global optimality. We have implemented this algorithm as a computer program, called P-MAP. Our test results on pathway mapping are highly encouraging - we have mapped a number of pathways of H. influenzae, B. subtilis, H. pylori, and M. tuberculosis to E. coli using P-MAP, whose homologous pathways in E coli. are known and hence the mapping accuracy could be checked. We have then mapped known E. coli pathways in the EcoCyc database to the newly sequenced organism Synechococcus sp WHS 102, and predicted 158 Synechococcus pathways. Detailed analyses on the predicted pathways indicate that P-MAP's mapping results are consistent with our general knowledge about (local) pathways. We believe that P-MAP will be a useful tool for microbial genome annotation projects and inference of individual microbial pathways.","","0-7695-2194","10.1109/CSB.2004.1332449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332449","","Bioinformatics;Genomics;Organisms;Computational systems biology;Biology computing;Biological information theory;Biochemistry;Computational biology;Steiner trees;Application software","genetics;molecular biophysics;biology computing;trees (mathematics);combinatorial mathematics;optimisation","microbial pathways;constrained mapping;orthologous genes;prokaryotic genome;orthologous gene relationship;operon structures;constrained minimum spanning tree problem;Steiner network problem;combinatorial optimization algorithm;global optimality;P-MAP;H. influenzae;B. subtilis;H. pylori;M. tuberculosis;E. coli;EcoCyc database;Synechococcus sp WHS 102;microbial genome annotation projects","","","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In operational timescales, the quadrature booster tap positions are optimised to eliminate or minimise any uplift in the total generation cost due to transmission thermal constraints. In planning the development of the transmission system, a frequent objective is to maximise the transfer capability of the existing network and thereby avoid unnecessary reinforcement. NGC has developed in-house software tools to automatically optimise the tap positions of interacting quadrature boosters.

Message passing network models are used to study these simulation alternatives. A set of experiments are carried out to understand how model parameters influence simulator performance. Experimental evidence leads to the conclusion that the optimistic simulator is not a viable tool for the analysis of this kind of models. The opposite conclusion applies to the other two: if the workload assigned to each logical process is above a certain threshold then the synchronization overhead is comparatively low and the simulators perform and scale well up to a large number of processors. The performance threshold is influenced by some parameters of the simulated model (size of the network, load level and message length), as well as by the number of processors used by the simulators.","","0-8186-7376","10.1109/EMPDP.1996.500590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=500590","","Discrete event simulation;Computational modeling;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Analytical models;Concurrent computing;Computer simulation;Parallel processing;Message passing;Testing;Intelligent networks","multiprocessor interconnection networks;discrete event simulation;message passing;synchronisation;software performance evaluation;parallel programming;virtual machines","empirical evaluation;parallel discrete-event simulation;interconnnection networks;synchronous simulation;conservative simulation;optimistic simulation;Intel Paragon multicomputer;model decomposition;collaborative logical processes;process synchronization overhead;causal restrictions;message-passing network models;model parameters;simulator performance;workload;scalability;performance threshold;network size;load level;message length;processor number","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of them rely on a selection of a global solution to an optimization problem according to a unique user-specific digital signature. Although such techniques may provide convincing proof of authorship with little hardware overhead, they fail to protect design partitions, do not provide an easy procedure for watermark detection, and are not capable of detecting the watermark when the design or its part is augmented in another larger design. Since these demands are of the highest interest for the IP business, we introduce localized watermarking as an IP protection technique which enables these features while satisfying the demand for low-cost and transparency.

Indeed, we present a complete analysis of the case when the optimal classifier between two normally distributed classes is pairwise and linear. We focus on some special cases of the normal distribution with nonequal covariance matrices. We determine the conditions that the mean vectors and covariance matrices have to satisfy in order to obtain the optimal pairwise linear classifier. As opposed to the state of the art, in all the cases discussed here, the linear classifier is given by a pair of straight lines, which is a particular case of the general equation of second degree. We also provide some empirical results, using synthetic data for the Minsky's paradox case, and demonstrated that the linear classifier achieves very good performance. Finally, we have tested our approach on real life data obtained from the UCI machine learning repository.

Features at different resolutions, from coarse to fine-grained, are implemented by means of a recursive classification scheme. Typically, recognizers have to balance the use of features at many resolutions (which yields a high accuracy), with the burden on computational resources in terms of storage space and processing time. We present in this paper, a method that adaptively determines the degree of resolution necessary in order to classify an input pattern. This leads to optimal use of computational resources. The hierarchical OCR dynamically adapts to factors such as the quality of the input pattern, its intrinsic similarities and differences from patterns of other classes it is being compared against, and the processing time available. Furthermore, the finer resolution is accorded to only certain ""zones"" of the input pattern which are deemed important given the classes that are being discriminated. Experimental results support the methodology presented. When tested on standard NIST data sets, the hierarchical OCR proves to be 300 times faster than a traditional K-nearest-neighbor classification method, and 10 times taster than a neural network method. The comparison uses the same feature set for all methods. Recognition rate of about 96 percent is achieved by the hierarchical OCR. This is at par with the other two traditional methods.","0162-8828;2160-9292;1939-3539","","10.1109/34.845383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845383","","Optical character recognition software;Character recognition;Testing;Pattern recognition;Venus;Senior members;NIST;Neural networks;Feature extraction","optical character recognition;image classification;optimisation;computational complexity","hierarchical OCR;multiresolution hierarchical feature space;recursive classification scheme;computational resource burden;storage space;processing time","","41","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two major efforts, the Portal to the Future Workshop and the Geoscience Digital Library (GDL) project, have established a vision for the library, a governance process to enable community ownership, management, and construction, and have begun development of a testbed collection, discovery system, and user interface. The DLESE Community Plan lays out in detail the need for this facility, a community vision for its goals and priorities, and a strategy for initial construction of the library. From this initial work, two conclusions emerge as paramount in moving forward with the library. First, it is essential that development of the library community and the building of the technological infrastructure for the library go hand in hand. Second, the library will be most effectively built as a highly coordinated, but distributed community effort. In this way, the full range of talents in the community can be leveraged and rapid development of the library is possible. This paper briefly reviews our technical accomplishments to date and outlines their plans for further development. Progress and plans can be charted in the following three areas: 1.

Extensible processors, which are getting increasingly popular in embedded system design, allow a designer to customize a base processor core through instruction set extensions. Existing processor energy macromodeling techniques are not applicable to extensible processors, since they assume that the instruction set architecture as well as the underlying structural description of the micro-architecture remain fixed. Our solution to the above problem is a hybrid energy macromodel suitably parameterized to estimate the energy consumption of an application running on the corresponding application-specific extended processor instance, which incorporates any custom instruction extension. Such a characterization is facilitated by careful selection of macromodel parameters/variables that can capture both the functional and structural aspects of the execution of a program on an extensible processor. Another feature of the proposed energy characterization flow is the use of regression analysis to build the macromodel. Regression analysis allows for in-situ characterization, thus allowing arbitrary test programs to be used during macromodel construction. We validated the proposed methodology by characterizing the energy consumption of a state-of-the-art extensible processor (Tensilica's Xtensa). We used the macromodel to analyze the energy consumption of several benchmark applications with custom instructions. The mean absolute error in the macromodel estimates is only 3.3%, when compared to the energy values obtained by a commercial tool operating on the synthesized register-transfer level (RTL) description of the custom processor. Our approach achieves an average speedup of three orders of magnitude over the commercial RTL energy estimator. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology also achieves good relative accuracy, which is essential in energy optimization studies. Hence, our technique is both efficient and accurate.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2004.826546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291578","","Energy consumption;Embedded system;Hardware;Regression analysis;Application software;Process design;Parameter estimation;Benchmark testing;Optimization methods;Application specific processors","microprocessor chips;application specific integrated circuits;low-power electronics;integrated circuit modelling;statistical analysis","extensible processors;energy estimation;embedded system;base processor core customization;instruction set extensions;energy characterization flow;regression analysis;register-transfer level description;application-specific instruction set processor","","13","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By simulating the timing of only the unique phases, the cycle-accurate simulation time for the SPEC suite is reduced from 5 months to 5 days, with a significant retention of the original dynamic behavior. Evaluation across many processor configurations within the same architecture family shows that the algorithm is robust. A cost function is provided that enables users to easily optimize the parameters of the algorithm for either simulation speed or accuracy depending on preference. A new measure is introduced to quantify the ability of a simulation speedup technique to retain behavior realized in the original workload.

ISPASS 2005.","","2005","","","42","53","As the costs and challenges of global clock distribution grow with each new microprocessor generation, a globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) approach becomes an attractive alternative. One proposed GALS approach, called a multiple clock domain (MCD) processor, achieves impressive energy savings for a relatively low performance cost. However, the approach requires separating the processor into four domains, including separating the integer and memory domains which complicates load scheduling, and the implementation of 32 voltage and frequency levels in each domain. In addition, the hardware-based control algorithm, though effective overall, produces a significant performance degradation for some applications. In this paper, we devise modifications to the MCD design that retain many of its benefits while greatly reducing the implementation complexity. We first determine that the synchronization channels that are most responsible for the MCD performance degradation are those involving cache access, and propose merging the integer and memory domains to virtually eliminate this overhead. We further propose significantly reducing the number of voltage levels, separating the reorder buffer into its own domain to permit front-end frequency scaling, separating the L2 cache to permit standard power optimizations to be used, and a new online algorithm that provides consistent results across our benchmark suite. The overall result is a significant reduction in the performance degradation of the original MCD approach and greater energy savings, with a greatly simplified microarchitecture that is much easier to implement","","0-7803-8965","10.1109/ISPASS.2005.1430558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1430558","","Energy efficiency;Degradation;Costs;Clocks;Voltage;Microprocessors;Synchronous generators;Processor scheduling;Frequency synchronization;Merging","benchmark testing;cache storage;clocks;computer architecture;microprocessor chips;synchronisation","energy efficient GALS processor;microarchitecture;globally asynchronous locally synchronous approach;multiple clock domain processor;synchronization channels;reorder buffer;L2 cache;benchmark suite;microprocessor chip","","3","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Programming MPSOCs can be challenging as several potentially conflicting issues such as data locality, parallelism and load balance across processors should be considered simultaneously. Most of the compilation techniques discussed in the literature for parallel architectures (not necessarily for MPSOCs) are loop based, i.e., they consider each loop nest in isolation. However, one key problem associated with such loop based techniques is that they fail to capture the interactions between the different loop nests in the application. This paper takes a more global approach to the problem and proposes a compiler-driven data locality optimization strategy in the context of embedded MPSOCs. An important characteristic of the proposed approach is that, in deciding the workloads of the processors (i.e., in parallelizing the application) it considers all the loop nests in the application simultaneously. The authors' experimental evaluation with eight embedded applications showed that the global scheme brings significant power/performance benefits over the conventional loop based scheme.","0738-100X","1-59593-058","10.1109/DAC.2005.193780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510299","","Computer architecture;Programming profession;Application software;Parallel programming;Permission;Logic programming;Frequency synchronization;Computer science;Design engineering;Parallel processing","system-on-chip;benchmark testing;embedded systems;microprocessor chips;microprogramming;parallel architectures","workload assignment;array based computations;MPSOC architectures;multiprocessor system on a chip;data locality;load balance;parallel architectures;locality optimization strategy","","1","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response we present CPX, a fast and memory-efficient tool for the extraction of common dataflow subgraphs from application binaries. Using this tool and a practical metric of pattern popularity, we analyze Media-Bench and Spec2000int benchmarks and present their most frequent communication patterns. Results confirm the intuition of prior research that dependence chains dominate integer code, but more importantly demonstrate that dataflow communication is restricted to a tractable set of templates. A set of only ten small patterns characterizes over 90% of Spec2000int and over 75% of MediaBench dynamic instructions.

Most distributed applications require, at least conceptually, some sort of shared state: information that is nonstatic but mostly read, and needed at more than one site. At the same time, RPC-based systems such as Sun RPC, Java RMl, CORBA, and .NET have become the de facto standards by which distributed applications communicate. As a result, shared state tends to be implemented either through the redundant transmission of deep-copy RPC parameters or through ad-hoc, application-specific caching and coherence protocols. The former option can waste large amounts of bandwidth; the latter significantly complicates program design and maintenance. To overcome these problems, we propose a distributed middleware system that works seamlessly with RPC-based systems, providing them with a global, persistent store that can be accessed using ordinary reads and writes. Relaxed coherence models and aggressive protocol optimizations reduce the bandwidth required to maintain shared state. Integrated support for transactions allows a chain of RPC calls to update shared state atomically. We focus on the implementation challenges involved in combining RPC with shared state and transactions. In particular, we describe a transaction metadata table that allows processes inside a transaction to share data invisible to other processes and to exchange data modifications efficiently. Using microbenchmarks and a large-scale datamining application, we demonstrate how the integration of RPC, transactions, and shared state facilitates the rapid development of robust, maintainable code.","","0-7695-2132","10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1302942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302942","","Application software;Java;Access protocols;Sun;Bandwidth;Coherence;Grid computing;Peer to peer computing;Programming profession;Computer science","remote procedure calls;middleware;protocols;bandwidth allocation;transaction processing;meta data;benchmark testing;data mining","remote invocation;distributed shared state;distributed applications;RPC-based systems;Sun RPC;Java RMl;CORBA;.NET;de facto standards;deep-copy RPC parameters;ad-hoc application-specific caching;coherence protocols;distributed middleware system;relaxed coherence models;aggressive protocol optimizations;bandwidth allocation;transaction metadata table;microbenchmarks;large-scale datamining application","","3","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contemporary media applications are highly complex and demand high performance. A distinctive feature of these applications is that they have significant parallelism, including thread- , data-, and instruction-level parallelism, that is potentially well-aligned with the increasing parallelism supported by emerging multi-core architectures. Designing systems to meet the demands of these applications therefore requires a benchmark suite comprising these complex applications and that exposes the parallelism present in them. This paper makes two contributions. First, it presents ALPBench, a publicly available benchmark suite that pulls together five complex media applications from various sources: speech recognition (CMU Sphinx 3), face recognition (CSU), ray tracing (Tachyon), MPEG-2 encode (MSSG), and MPEG-2 decode (MSSG). We have modified the original applications to expose thread-level and data-level parallelism using POSIX threads and sub-word SIMD (Inters SSE2) instructions respectively. Second, the paper provides a performance characterization of the ALPBench benchmarks, with a focus on parallelism. Such a characterization is useful for architects and compiler writers for designing systems and compiler optimizations for these applications.","","0-7803-9461","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1525999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1525999","","Parallel processing;Application software;Yarn;Speech recognition;Face recognition;Ray tracing;Decoding;Kernel;Videoconference;Computer architecture","multimedia computing;benchmark testing;multi-threading;speech recognition;face recognition;ray tracing;video coding;decoding","ALPBench benchmark suite;complex multimedia applications;thread-level parallelism;data-level parallelism;instruction-level parallelism;speech recognition;CMU Sphinx 3;face recognition;ray tracing;Tachyon;MPEG-2 encode;MPEG-2 decode;POSIX threads;sub-word SIMD;Inters SSE2 instructions;compiler optimizations","","43","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One reason is to improve benchmark universality by demanding resources every computer is likely to have. But users dynamically increase the size of application programs to match the power available, whereas most benchmarks are static and of a size appropriate for computers available when the benchmark was created; this is particularly true for parallel computers. Thus, the benchmark overstates computer performance since smaller problems spend more time in cache. Scalable benchmarks, such as HINT, examine the full spectrum of performance through various memory regimes, and express a superset of the information given by any particular fixed size benchmark. Using 5000 experimental measurements, we have found that performance on the NAS Parallel Benchmarks, SPEC, LINPACK, and other benchmarks is predicted accurately by subsets of HINT performance curve.

No.01TH8542)","","2001","2","","2/709","2/718 vol.2","The purpose of this research was to develop a software tool for generating optimal target servicing strategies for imaging fixed ground targets with a spaceborne SAR. Given a list of targets and their corresponding geographic locations and relative priorities, this tool generates a target servicing strategy that maximizes the overall collection utility based on the number of targets successfully imaged weighted by their relative priorities. This tool is specifically designed to maximize sensor utility in the case of a target-rich environment. For small numbers of targets, a target servicing strategy is unnecessary, and the targets may be imaged in any order without paying any particular attention to geographic proximity or target priority. However, for large, geographically diverse target decks, the order in which targets are serviced is of great importance. The target servicing problem is shown to be of the class NP-hard, and thus cannot be solved to optimality in polynomial time. Therefore, global search techniques such as genetic algorithms are called for. A unique hybrid algorithm that combines genetic algorithms with simulated annealing has been developed to generate optimized target servicing strategies. The performance of this hybrid algorithm was compared against that of three different greedy algorithms in a series of 20 test cases. Preliminary results indicate consistent performance improvements over greedy algorithms for target-rich environments. Over the course of 20 trials, the hybrid optimizing algorithm produced weighted collection scores that were on average 10% higher than the best greedy algorithm.","","0-7803-6599","10.1109/AERO.2001.931250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931250","","Genetic algorithms;Hybrid power systems;Synthetic aperture radar;Greedy algorithms;Spaceborne radar;Image sensors;Software algorithms;Space technology;Business;Springs","synthetic aperture radar;genetic algorithms;target tracking;simulated annealing;radar imaging","hybrid genetic algorithm;synthetic aperture radar;target servicing strategies;fixed ground targets;spaceborne SAR;geographic locations;overall collection utility;sensor utility;target-rich environment;geographic proximity;geographically diverse target decks;NP-hard;global search techniques;simulated annealing;greedy algorithms;target-rich environments;hybrid optimizing algorithm;weighted collection scores","","2","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional imaging methods lack the resolution or are impractical for assessing early OA. Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has demonstrated a feasibility for assessing articular cartilage. In vitro studies have demonstrated that OCT can determine cartilage width at a resolution of 20 /spl mu/m in addition to the identification of fibrillations, fibrosis, and breakdown of the subcondral plate. It was also noted that the normal cartilage was polarization sensitive. In the study, two theories are tested. The first hypothesis is that the origin of polarization sensitivity in normal cartilage is organized collagen. The second hypothesis is that the loss of polarization sensitivity, and therefore collagen disorganization, is a sign of osteoarthritis that precedes cartilage thinning.","","1-55752-634","10.1109/CLEO.2000.907316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=907316","","Optical polarization;Tomography;Osteoarthritis;Optical sensors;Microscopy;Optical character recognition software;Optimized production technology;Aging;Electric breakdown;Joints","optical tomography;proteins;light coherence;biomedical imaging;sensitivity;light polarisation;diseases","polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography;osteoarthritis;collagen disorganization;disability;morbidity;conventional imaging methods;resolution;optical coherence tomography;feasibility;articular cartilage;in vitro studies;cartilage width;fibrillations;fibrosis;breakdown;subcondral plate;normal cartilage;polarization sensitive cartilage;polarization sensitivity;organized collagen;cartilage thinning","","1","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the fluxing underfill process, the underfill is dispensed onto the board prior to die placement. During placement, the underfill flows in a ""squeeze flow"" process until the solder balls contact the pads on the board. The material properties, the dispense pattern and resulting shape, solder mask design pattern, placement force, placement speed, and hold time all impact the placement process and the potential for void formation. A design of experiments was used to optimize the placement process to minimize placement-induced voids. The major factor identified was board design, followed by placement acceleration. During the reflow cycle, the fluxing underfill provides the fluxing action required for good wetting and then cures by the end of the reflow cycle. With small, homogeneous circuit boards it is relatively easy to develop a reflow profile to achieve good solder wetting.

The features which are invariant to changes in rotation, position and shifts, although not to changes in scale are optimized through the use of feature selection techniques. The classification stage successively takes as its inputs the multidimensional multiple observation sequences, parameterizes them statistically using continuous density models to capture target and background appearance variability, and thus results in the TRIATR-HMMs. Experimental results have demonstrated that the recognition rate is as high as 99% over both the training set and the testing set.","1520-6149","0-7803-4428","10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=675451","","Hidden Markov models;Target recognition;Discrete Fourier transforms;Speech recognition;Signal processing;Image processing;Application software;Feature extraction;Semiconductor device measurement;Multidimensional systems","synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;radar target recognition;hidden Markov models;feature extraction;image classification;Radon transforms","hidden Markov modelling;SAR automatic target recognition;hidden Markov models;rotational invariant automatic target recognition;SAR imagery;translational invariant automatic target recognition;preprocessing;feature extraction;feature selection;classification;measurements;Radon transform;target chips;position;shifts;multidimensional multiple observation sequences;continuous density models;background appearance variability;target appearance variability;experimental results;TRIATR-HMM;recognition rate;training set;testing set","","7","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The criterion for optimal sensor configuration is based on maximizing the overall sensor response while minimizing the correlation among the sensor outputs, so as to minimize the redundant information being provided by the multiple sensors. The procedure for sensor configuration is based on the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. SPSA avoids the need for detailed modeling of the sensor response by simply relying on the observed responses obtained by limited experimentation with test sensor configurations.

For randomly generated defect patterns, a proposed algorithm with a hill-climbing capability successfully repaired memory arrays in 98% cases, as opposed to RMs 20% cases. It is demonstrated how, by using very small silicon overhead, one can implement this algorithm in hardware within a VLSI chip for built in self repair (BISR) of memory arrays.

The network reported by the authors in 1990 can make use of other gradient methods. Experiments with the steepest descent/ascent and conjugate gradients algorithms show a potential decrease in the number of iterations. The contours of the network's function showed considerable variation, especially close to the local optima. This nature restricted the line search algorithms that could be used.

These include tools from academia like Ptolemy and GRAPE, and commercial tools like SPW from Cadence Design Systems, Cossap from Synopsys, and the HP ADS tool from HP. The block diagram languages used in these environments are usually based on dataflow semantics because various subsets of dataflow have proven to be good matches for expressing and modeling signal processing systems. In particular synchronous dataflow (SDF) has been found to be a particularly good match for expressing multirate signal processing systems. One of the key problems that arises during synthesis from an SDF specification is scheduling. Past work on scheduling from SDF has focused on optimization of program memory and buffer memory. However, no attempt was made for overlaying or sharing buffers. In this paper we formally tackle the problem of generating optimally compact schedules for SDF graphs, that also attempt to minimize buffering memory under the assumption that buffers will be shared. This will result in schedules whose data memory usage is drastically lower (up to 83%) than methods in the past have achieved.","","0-7695-0537","10.1109/DATE.2000.840303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840303","","Registers;Digital signal processing;Signal processing;Educational institutions;Prototypes;Pipelines;Signal design;Signal synthesis;Software libraries;High level languages","shared memory systems;data flow computing;array signal processing;processor scheduling;buffer storage","shared memory implementations;synchronous dataflow specifications;DSP systems;dataflow semantics;multirate signal processing systems;SDF specification;scheduling;optimally compact schedules;buffering memory","","5","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We deal with an estimation problem for which surface albedo information is not available. In this case, the estimation problem corresponds to an underdetermined one. We show that combination of regularization by correlation and some user-specified information can be a practical method for solving the problem.

"Hardware-in-the-loop-simulation of a vehicle climate controller with a combined HVAC and passenger compartment model","D. Michalek; C. Gehsat; R. Trapp; T. Bertram","NA; NA; NA; NA","Proceedings, 2005 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics.","","2005","","","1065","1070","A good example for a complex mechatronic system is a modern vehicle. It covers a lot of subsystems which solve different tasks but are often coupled. The automatic air conditioning system is one of those subsystems. It consists, especially in vehicles of higher categories, of a high number of distributed mechatronic actuators and sensors and a central controller. The aim of such a system is to achieve a desired climatic condition in the vehicle interior which leads to a higher comfort for the passengers and therefore it also increases indirect the safety in road traffic. The climatic condition is defined by the interior temperature, its layering, the humidity and the velocity of the airflow blowing through the passenger compartment. For the adjustment of the desired interior climate with the available air conditioning components complex control algorithms are necessary. This control task is performed by the climate controller, which includes all control strategies in form of software programs. Beneath the construction of all system parts, a further challenge is the design of the control which includes the design of the controller hardware as well as the control strategies. By applying modern structured development methods for mechatronic systems like the modified V-model [VDI 2206, 2004] the development time and the costs can be reduced whereas the quality can be improved by using a model based approach. Fundamental part of this strategy are the X-in-the-loop-simulation (XIL-simulation) methods, where all system parts, which can be pure virtual in form of models or real elements, are considered in interaction. This is done for verification and validation of the system parts and the software. By using this technique in the concrete case of the climate controller, its hardware as well as the applied control strategies can be tested and optimized in conjunction with a real time computer that is connected to the controller via appropriate interfaces. Models running on the real time computer simulate the air conditioning system. Thus it is possible to close the control loops in a partially virtual system. In contrast to this approach, conventional development strategies, where most control loops can be considered for the first time at the assembled system, are very time consuming and cost intensive because real test drives have to be carried out for the verification and validation processes. This is especially essential for tests under different climatic conditions like summer and winter tests. In case of the software- and hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (SIL- and HIL-simulation) for an air conditioning controller, models of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning elements (HVAC) and the passenger compartment are necessary. A main demand for the HIL-Simulation is the real time capability. Therefore it is a challenge to create simple but accurate models, that enable a fast calculation of the wanted values. In this paper both models, the HVAC and the single zone passenger compartment model and their interfaces would be presented. Further results of both models interacting in a HIL-simulation on a commercial hardware platform connected via interfaces to the climate controller would be shown","2159-6247;2159-6255","0-7803-9047","10.1109/AIM.2005.1511151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511151","","Air conditioning;Control systems;Mechatronics;Hardware;Testing;Automatic control;Vehicle safety;Road safety;Costs;Actuators","automotive engineering;control engineering computing;digital simulation;HVAC;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","hardware-in-the-loop-simulation;vehicle climate controller;HVAC;passenger compartment model;automatic air conditioning system;road traffic;road safety;software-in-the-loop-simulation","","7","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Teams in IBM and other organizations that use the process are achieving remarkable quality results with high productivity. A phased implementation of the Cleanroom process enables quality and productivity improvements with an increased control of change.

Thus, the method manages systematically the relative distortion between a candidate shape and its prototype, accomplishing robustness to noise with less than two prototypes per class, on the average. Our method uses a flexible matching between components and a flexible grouping of the individual components to be matched. A number of shape transformations are defined. Also, a measure of the amount of distortion that these transformations cause is given. The problem of classification of character shapes is defined as a problem of optimization among the possible transformations that map an input shape into prototypical shapes.

These messages are computationally expensive to decode, partly because decoding each data field requires resting one or more tag fields. Evidence suggests that in some applications, although the potential space of message encodings may be very large, only a small number of message layouts are seen frequently, and thus some of the work required in decoding can be amortized over many messages.

Performance in building from memory an 80-piece object is assessed for six different groups. The main comparison is between groups which have interactive instructions and are allowed to build during training, and groups that have the same instructions but are not followed to build during training. The 'build' groups never perform better from memory than the 'no build' groups (on structure or efficiency) and sometimes perform significantly worse. An explanation is offered using a framework for multimedia concepts in memory.

The recognition is performed in two stages. In the first stage the class is determined. Templates for this stage are created using the subclass templates. Assignment into subclasses occurs in the second stage. This two stage approach may be used to accelerate template matching. In particular, the second stage may be omitted when only the class needs to be determined. The authors present a method for optimal aggregation of subclass templates into class templates. For each class, the new template is optimal in that it maximizes the worst case (i.e. minimum) correlation with its subclass templates. An algorithm which solves this maximin optimization problem is presented and its correctness is proved. In addition, test results are provided, indicating that the algorithm's execution time is polynomial in the number of subclass templates. The authors show tight bounds on the maximin correlation. The bounds are functions only of the number of original subclass templates and the minimum element in their correlation matrix. The algorithm is demonstrated on a multifont optical character recognition problem.<<ETX>>","0162-8828;2160-9292;1939-3539","","10.1109/34.385977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=385977","","Pattern recognition;Character recognition;Nearest neighbor searches;Optical character recognition software;Optical noise;Acceleration;Testing;Polynomials;Clustering algorithms;Minimax techniques","pattern recognition;minimax techniques;optical character recognition;correlation methods","multiple subclass pattern recognition;maximin correlation approach;template matching;maximin optimization problem;correctness;multifont optical character recognition problem","","15","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for graph partitioning with an objective function that follows the min-max clustering principle. The relaxed version of the optimization of the min-max cut objective function leads to the Fiedler vector in spectral graph partitioning. Theoretical analyses of min-max cut indicate that it leads to balanced partitions, and lower bounds are derived. The min-max cut algorithm is tested on newsgroup data sets and is found to out-perform other current popular partitioning/clustering methods. The linkage-based refinements to the algorithm further improve the quality of clustering substantially. We also demonstrate that a linearized search order based on linkage differential is better than that based on the Fiedler vector, providing another effective partitioning method.","","0-7695-1119","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989507","","Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Helium;Laboratories;Computer science;Mathematics;Application software;Mathematical model;Testing;Clustering methods","minimax techniques;graph theory;pattern clustering;data mining;vectors","min-max cut algorithm;graph partitioning;data clustering;graph model;data object pairwise similarities;weighted graph adjacency matrix;objective function;relaxed optimization;Fiedler vector;spectral graph partition;balanced partitions;lower bounds;newsgroup data sets;algorithm performance;linkage-based refinements;clustering quality;linearized search order;linkage differential","","226","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, daily and seasonal temperature variations are a limitation on the application of solar power to homes. At lower temperatures, PV systems produce more power. For higher temperatures, optimum operation requires modification of electrical load and removal of excess heat. Several technologies and approaches are available. To pursue this system optimization, PV cells were investigated at different temperatures. These investigations are compared with simulated theoretical results to draw more specific conclusions that can be applied to a solar house. A temperature reduction of 60/spl deg/C improved the power by up to twenty-seven percent with the current test cell. The simulations matched this conclusion and can be applied to the PV array used on a house. The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) and Rolla Technical Institute (RTI) jointly built a solar house for the 2002 National Solar Decathlon Competition. This house is the motivation and testbed for our research. The first application is to cool the cell; then compare the additional amount of power produced with the amount of power required to cool the cell. The feasibility of cooling the array is discussed. This paper first gives a description of the UMR/RTI solar house, a literature review, and overview. Temperature-dependence theory and experiments is given next.

We also describe the early 2004 ground test validation of specific OASIS components on selected Mars exploration rover (MER) images.

Database search depends on the user's profile of likes and dislikes and how the user ranks similar images. A neural fuzzy system can help learn an agent profile of a user. The fuzzy system uses if-then rules that store and compress the agent's knowledge of the user's likes and dislikes. A neural system uses training data to form and tune the rules. The profile is a preference map or a bumpy utility surface over the space of search objects. Rules define fuzzy patches that cover the bumps as learning unfolds and as the fuzzy agent system gives a finer approximation of the profile. The agent system searches for preferred objects with the learned profile and a new fuzzy measure of similarity. We derive a new supervised learning law that tunes this matching measure with new sample data. Then we test the fuzzy agent profile system on object spaces of flowers and sunsets and test the fuzzy agent matching system on an object space of sunset images.","1092-9959","0-8186-8010","10.1109/ADL.1997.601197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=601197","","Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy sets;Image databases;Filters;Intelligent agent;System testing;Signal processing;Image processing;Image coding;Training data","visual databases;software agents;learning (artificial intelligence);fuzzy neural nets;image matching","fuzzy agents;preference map;intelligent agent;fuzzy patches;bumpy utility surface;learned profile;finer approximation;matching measure;images","","","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prognostic utility for the signature features are determined by transitional failure experiments. Such experiments provide evidence for the failure alert threshold and of the likely advance warning one can expect by tracking the feature(s) continuously. Kalman filters are used to track changes in features like vibration levels, mode frequencies, or other waveform signature features. This information is then functionally associated with load conditions using fuzzy logic and expert human knowledge of the physics and the underlying mechanical systems. Herein is the greatest challenge to engineering. However, it is straightforward to track the progress of relevant features over time using techniques such as Kalman filtering. Using the predicted states, one can then estimate the future failure hazard, probability of survival, and remaining useful life in an automated and objective methodology.","","0-7803-6599","10.1109/AERO.2001.931317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931317","","Prediction algorithms;Predictive maintenance;Hazards;Asset management;Technology management;Particle measurements;Availability;Cost function;Vibrations;Frequency","maintenance engineering;Kalman filters;tracking filters;diagnostic expert systems;diagnostic reasoning;machine testing;reliability;fault diagnosis;condition monitoring;computerised monitoring;fuzzy logic;software agents;feature extraction;sensor fusion","predictive maintenance;general prognostic tracking algorithm;prognostic health management;failure hazard;objective measurements;availability;reliability;total cost of ownership;signature features;failure alert threshold;Kalman filters;fuzzy logic;expert human knowledge;future failure hazard;probability of survival;reliability centered maintenance;automated logistics;machine faults;automated reasoning;intelligent agents;intelligent sensors","","42","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We call such a methodology the query-driven net reduction. The philosophy behind this methodology is that different analyses demand different aspects of information from the system. An optimized analysis model should only contain the necessary information. In addition to reachability graph generation, the linear algebraic method is also investigated as a follow-up analysis technique.

With appropriate models of performance perturbation, these perturbations in execution time can be reduced to less than 20% while retaining the additional information from detailed traces.

It is achieved by, separating the WCET analysis process in three stages and by analysing the Java byte code, not the high-level source code, thus enabling the analysis of programs written in other languages (such as Ada and compiled for the Java virtual machine). The three stages are: a Java virtual machine platform dependent (low-level) analysis, a software dependent (high-level) analysis and an on-line integration step.","","0-7695-1558","10.1109/ISORC.2002.1003664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003664","","Java;Timing;Testing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Computer science;Real time systems;Processor scheduling;Hardware;Optimizing compilers","Java;real-time systems;processor scheduling","Java virtual machine support;portable worst-case execution-time analysis;Real-Time Java;Real-Time Core extensions;schedulability analysis;portability;Java byte code;software dependent analysis;on-line integration step","","8","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first is a direct optimization approach that handles more general systems and more varied constraints. It requires more sophisticated software but it's easily adapted to more than two models. The second algorithm is a constrained control approach that can be implemented on common math software, such as Matlab or Scilab, and handles model uncertainty.

The authors propose a simple yet efficient transformation based algorithm in order to conceal network losses in streaming real time audio and video data over the Internet. In the receiver side, we adopt a simple reconstruction algorithm based on interpolation, as sophisticated concealment techniques cannot be employed in software based real time playback. In the sender side, we design a linear transformation with the objective of minimizing the mean squared error, assuming that some of the descriptions are lost and that the missing information is reconstructed by simple averaging at the destination. We further integrate the transformations in case of video streaming in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to produce an optimized reconstruction based DCT.

While PROP's gain function has a greater futuristic component than PM or LA, it incorporates spatially local information-only information on the removal probabilities of adjacent nets of a cell is used in its gain computation. This prevents a higher-level view of nonlocal structures. Also, giving uniform weights to all nets, results in an inability to differentiate between the futuristic benefit of removing one net from another. This paper investigates for the first time the issues of using nonlocal structural information in gain functions and variable net weights based on the futuristic (stochastic) benefit of moving them from the cutset. The result is a more sophisticated partitioner DEEP-PROP that performs better for circuits with large complexities by incorporating more nonlocal (second order) structural information than PROP. The second-order information is incorporated into cell gains as well as variable net weights-the latter helps to focus future cell moves in the ""right"" cluster around the currently moved cell and, thus, better utilizes the information that led to its selection as the best move. A lower complexity version, variable weight PROP (VAR-PROP), that also uses dynamically assigned variable net weights, but based on first-order information, has also been developed. Both versions yield significant improvements over PROP on the ACM/SIGDA benchmark suite. DEEP-PROP yields mincut improvements of as much as 39% and an average of 20% for large circuits (10-K to 25-K cells) and an average of 14% over all circuits. DEEP PROP is about a factor of 2.8 times slower than PROP, which is very fast. VAR-PROP, which has a much lower computational complexity than DEEP-PROP, yields for large circuits, maximum and average mincut improvements over PROP of 27% and 18%, respectively, and an average of 12.6% improvement over all circuits. It is only about 14% slower than PROP, For the only very large circuit golem3 in the suite (>100 K cells), the improvements produced by DEEP-PROP and VAR-PROP over PROP are 15.6% and 11.5%, respectively. We also compare DEEP-PROP to FM, PROP and hMetis for a subset of the newer 1SPD98 benchmark circuits, and demonstrate significant improvements over FM and PROP, and comparable mincuts (within 2%) to hMetis, one of the best multilevel partitioners.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/43.752926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=752926","","Partitioning algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Very large scale integration;Circuit testing;Gain;Stochastic processes;Computational complexity;Large scale integration;Application software;Optimization methods","VLSI;integrated circuit layout;circuit layout CAD;logic partitioning;iterative methods;computational complexity;stochastic processes","second-order information;stochastic-gain functions;probability-based partitioning algorithm;PROP;spatially local information;removal probabilities;adjacent nets;gain computation;nonlocal structures;uniform weights;gain functions;variable net weights;dynamically assigned variable net weights;ACM/SIGDA benchmark suite;computational complexity;VAR-PROP;mincut improvements;ISPD98 benchmark circuits;multilevel partitioners;VLSI","","1","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we deal with the problem of concealment of whole frame-losses, and propose a novel technique which is capable of handling this very critical case. The proposed technique presents other two major innovations with respect to the state-of-the-art: i) it is based on optical flow estimation applied to error concealment and ii) it performs multiframe estimation, thus optimally exploiting the multiple reference frame buffer featured by the most modern video coders such as H.263+ and H.264. If data partitioning is employed, by e.g., sending headers, motion vectors, and coding modes in prioritized packets as can be done in the DiffServ network model, the algorithm is capable of exploiting the motion vectors to improve the error concealment results. The algorithm has been embedded in the H.264 test model software, and tested under both independent and correlated packet loss models with parameters typical of the wireless environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other techniques by several dBs in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), provides good visual quality, and has a rather low complexity, which makes it possible to perform real-time operation with reasonable computational resources.","1520-9210;1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2005.843347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407904","Optical flow estimation;packet-based video transmission;video error concealment;whole-frame losses;wireless communications","Optical losses;Image motion analysis;Optical buffering;State estimation;Partitioning algorithms;Software testing;PSNR;Payloads;Technological innovation;Estimation error","video coding;video streaming;video databases;DiffServ networks;image sequences;wireless LAN;packet switching;error statistics","multiframe optical flow estimation;error concealment algorithms;multiple reference frame buffer;video coders;data partition;DiffServ network model;packet loss models;wireless communications;signal-to-noise ratio;visual quality;packet-based video transmission;video error concealment;whole-frame losses","","66","37","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Even for the latter type of locomotion, designing control method is more difficult than ordinary robots. This is because the module configuration includes many degrees of freedom and there are a wide variety of possible configurations.

The new equilibrium model has the following main properties: i) every scheduled generator satisfies its minimum surplus (or bid profit) condition; ii) the energy price is a system marginal cost (a Lagrange multiplier associated with the power balance constraint in the related economic dispatch problem where all of the discrete variables are fixed to their optimal values); iii) the power balance and all of the generators' technical constraints are satisfied.

Such an identification of process dynamics is necessary in process-adaptive control systems. A testing signal and correlating filter are employed after the manner of Turin. Such a procedure requires no multiplier, and the output of the filter is the impulse response as a continuous function of real time. To reduce accompanying output noise, the method of adding coherently the results of a number of tests made in succession is proposed. This idea is applied to the measurement of a member of an ensemble of slowly varying impulse responses. Optimum design of both the correlating filter and the necessary test signal is determined on the basis of minimum mean-square error of the resulting estimate. The optimization of the number of tests to be included in a measurement is described. The general results are applied to the case of a single, slowly time-varying process. In addition to optimum design, normalized curves showing the optimum number of tests for a particular mode of variation are included. A second application is made to the problem of measuring a member of an ensemble of fixed processes.

This study proposes a simulation that allows computer modeling of both tracer kinetics and different acquisition schemes. /sup 99m/Tc Teboroxime (Bracco Diagnostics) is used as a model. SPECT acquisition of a software phantom (NCAT, UNC Chapel Hill) is simulated with photon attenuation, collimator resolution, Compton scatter, Poisson noise, and changing tracer distribution. Short-axis uniformity is used to assess the severity of artifacts in the myocardium. The simulation produces similar artifacts to those found in patient studies with /sup 99m/Tc Teboroxime. This simulation methodology can provide a valuable tool for testing novel acquisition and processing techniques and to facilitate the optimization of SPECT images of changing tracer distributions. Summed fanning (back and forth) acquisitions have been tested and artifact reduced short-axis images obtained. Image restoration techniques are proposed to further improve the image quality.

However, this methodology often leads to nonconvex optimization problems, which are difficult to solve for fast processes, i.e. processes with small sampling times. This paper proposes a new methodology to apply a fuzzy predictive controller in real-time by using a neural network architecture, which receives data from the process and computes the control actions. Thus, the neural network is learned off-line, and its final structure guarantees that control actions are computed very rapidly.

KES '97","","1997","1","","2","11 vol.1","A generic model of a complete electric power grid (including generation, transmission, distribution and loads), based on multiple adaptive, intelligent agents, is being developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRT). Its ultimate purpose is to model the computational intelligence required for distributed control of a geographically dispersed but globally interconnected power network. The current worldwide trend toward free competition in electric power, combined with the new availability of very high voltage active control devices, generates the requirement and provides the means for totally distributed sensing, computation and control. The multiple agents-based model and simulation being developed will also serve as a ""scenario-free"" testbed for ""what if"" studies and computer experiments to provide insight into the evolution of the electric enterprise in response to various economic pressures and technological advances. Early work in this area has emphasized modeling market forces and strategies limited only by the physics of electricity and the topology of the grid. Ultimately, this model will test whether any central authority is required, or even desirable, and whether free economic cooperation and competition can, by itself, optimize the efficiency and security of network operation for the mutual benefit of all.","","0-7803-3755","10.1109/KES.1997.616845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=616845","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Distributed control;Power systems;Power generation;Computational modeling;Voltage control;Testing;Power generation economics;Mesh generation","distributed control;software agents;electricity supply industry;distribution networks;power system control;intelligent control","adaptive agents;distributed control;electric power grid;competitive electric power industry;intelligent agents;computational intelligence;multiple agents-based model;scenario-free","","3","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The amount of information accessible from the web has dramatically increased by several orders of magnitude in the last few years, and shows no signs of abating. Developers of web search engines are confronted with the consequent information overload problem. Although many algorithms are widely used to optimize the performance of web search engines, it is still difficult to decrease the updating cycles of the web data for a traditional general-purpose search and indexing system. In this paper, an autonomous system (AS) based solution is presented. One of its main merits is to limit the network load inside an AS. Since AS is the element of the Internet interconnection and a uniformed route strategy is adopted inside an AS, it will be helpful to solve global network overload problem. At the other side, updating cycles are greatly decreased since the distributed system is working in a parallel way at different ASes. Some key algorithms and techniques are put forward and tested for management and synchronization of the whole system. The effectiveness of the solution is verified in laboratory simulation.","1062-922X","0-7803-7087","10.1109/ICSMC.2001.969851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969851","","Web search;Search engines;Internet;Uniform resource locators;IP networks;System testing;Packaging;Robots;Network servers;Web server","search engines;information networks","Web search;computer networks;search engines;autonomous system;distributed system;load-balanced algorithm","","","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we conduct an empirical performance evaluation on the PC platform of some of the most popular networking API which include: Winsock/BSD, Java, and RMI. To explore the impact of the underlying operating system and Java virtual machine (JVM) architecture, we conducted performance tests on two operating systems namely, Windows NT 4.0 and Solaris 8. We found that on both operating system platforms, Winsock and BSD sockets yield about 1.8 times better throughput than Java sockets, and Java sockets in turn yield twice the throughput of that obtained using remote method invocation (RMI). We also obtained about 1.3 times higher latency overheads with Java compared to either Winsock or BSD as well as with RMI when compared to Java sockets on both Windows NT and Solaris operating systems. We hope that our results will be useful to application designers and developers in better optimizing end-to-end application performance.","","0-7695-1916","10.1109/ITCC.2003.1197551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197551","","Operating systems;Information technology","application program interfaces;network operating systems;software performance evaluation;Java;delays","performance comparison;operating systems;communication API;application programming interfaces;PC platform;Winsock/BSD;RMI;JVM architecture;Windows NT 4.0;Solaris 8;Java sockets;throughput;remote method invocation;latency overheads;Java virtual machine","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective function is optimized in an iterative fashion with respect to both the feature weights and the SVM parameters (i.e. the support vector weights and the bias values). In this paper, we use this procedure to optimize the relative weights of various subsets of features in two SVM-based speaker recognition systems: a system that uses transform coefficients obtained from maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) as features (A. Stolcke, et al., 2005) and another that uses relative frequencies of phone n-grams (W. M. Campbell, et al., 2003), (A. Hatch, et al., 2005).

With this new method, we are able to successfully employ a utilization-based admission control approach for flow admission. This approach does not require explicit delay computation at admission time and hence is scalable to large systems. We assume the underlying network to use static-priority schedulers. We design and analyze several priority assignment algorithms, and investigate their ability to achieve higher utilization bounds. Traditionally, schedulers in differentiated services networks assign priorities on a class-by-class basis, with the same priority for each class on each router. We show that relaxing this requirement, that is, allowing different routers to assign different priorities to classes, achieves significantly higher utilization bounds.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916255","","Admission control;Job shop scheduling;Diffserv networks;Delay effects;Processor scheduling;Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Application software;System testing;Intelligent networks","Internet;telecommunication congestion control;delays;telecommunication network routing;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;performance evaluation","absolute differentiated services;real-time applications;static-priority scheduling networks;worst-case delay analysis;delay bounds;utilization-based admission control;flow admission;static-priority schedulers;priority assignment algorithms;utilization bounds;differentiated services networks;router;Internet;heuristic algorithms;QoS architecture;performance evaluation;traffic model","","15","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An optimum range for R is shown to exist in order to minimize the time needed to reach the minimum of the cost function.

It is shown that epistasis, as expressed by the dominance of the flow and distance matrices of a QAP instance, the landscape ruggedness in terms of the correlation length of a landscape, and the correlation between fitness and distance of local optima in the landscape together are useful for predicting the performance of memetic algorithms-evolutionary algorithms incorporating local search (to a certain extent).

The ability of the device materials to withstand stress due to the growing electrical and thermal loading will be of particular importance. The design optimization as well as the material analysis thus demand analytical tools with high lateral resolution, high bandwidth capability, and high sensitivity. In this paper we demonstrate that scanning probe microscopy (SPM) employing integrated probes is a promising candidate for not only imaging topography but simultaneously electrical and thermal device properties. For voltage contrast imaging a coplanar waveguide cantilever was designed and fabricated to be used in high frequency scanning electrical force microscopy (HFSEFM). Additionally it is demonstrated that an in a tip of a cantilever probe integrated Schottky diode is useful for thermal surface imaging with highest temperature resolution in scanning thermal microscopy (SThM). The batch fabrication processes of both probes will be briefly introduced. Fabricated probes are characterized and first results obtained with these novel probes are presented.","1094-2734","0-7803-4057","10.1109/ICT.1997.667631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=667631","","High-resolution imaging;Surface topography;Bandwidth;Thermal stresses;Scanning probe microscopy;Very large scale integration;Application specific integrated circuits;Application software;Computer applications;Thermal loading","scanning probe microscopy;integrated circuit measurement;integrated circuit testing;micromachining;microsensors;temperature distribution;surface potential;VLSI;Schottky diodes;coplanar waveguides;photothermal effects","scanning probe microscopy;integrated probes;topography imaging;electrical imaging;thermal surface imaging;surface properties;high lateral resolution;voltage contrast imaging;coplanar waveguide cantilever;HF scanning electrical force microscopy;cantilever probe integrated Schottky diode;scanning thermal microscopy;batch fabrication processes;high bandwidth capability;high sensitivity;VLSI;Coulomb force;micromachining","","","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network workloads can be classified into data plane and control plane workloads, however most network processors are optimized for data plane. Also, existing benchmark suites for network processors primarily contain data plane workloads, which perform packet processing for a forwarding function. We present a set of benchmarks, called NpBench, targeted towards control plane (e.g., traffic management, quality of service, etc.) as well as data plane workloads. The characteristics of NpBench workloads, such as instruction mix, parallelism, cache behavior and required processing capability per packet, are presented and compared with CommBench, an existing network processor benchmark suite [T.

No silicon fabrication of circuits with topologies designed by evolution has been done before, leaving open questions on the feasibility of the evolutionary circuit design approach, as well as on how high-performance, robust, or portable such designs could be when implemented in hardware. It is argued that moving from evolutionary 'design-for-experimentation' to 'design-for-implementation' requires, beyond inclusion in the fitness function of measures indicative of circuit evaluation factors such as power consumption and robustness to temperature variations, the addition of certain evaluation techniques that are not common in conventional design. Several such techniques that were found to be useful in evolving designs for implementation are presented; some are general, and some are particular to the problem domain of transistor-level logic design, used here as a target application. The example used here is a multifunction NAND/NOR logic gate circuit, for which evolution obtained a creative circuit topology more compact than what has been achieved by multiplexing a NAND and a NOR gate. The circuit was fabricated in a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS technology and silicon tests showed good correspondence with the simulations.","1350-2387","","10.1049/ip-cdt:20040503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318864","","","data compression;genetic algorithms;image coding;ISO standards","lossless image compression;high resolution bi-level images;compression method;image data;evolvable hardware chip;bi-level image coding;JBIG2;genetic algorithm;software execution;ISO standardisation;optimisation","","33","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

However with the customer base increasing at an alarming rate, the number of stored calls is increasing dramatically and the number of empty messages, or slamdowns as they are known in the trade, is becoming problematic. A method of detecting these empty messages so that they can be deleted before they are stored was required. Algorithms were developed by using real data recorded on a 'live' system and assessing their performance. Having extracted suitable coefficients from segments of the data using standard digital processing techniques, a multiperceptron artificial neural network was used to produce a logical speech/nospeech result. The network was optimised by investigating aspects such as the training data, the test data, number of hidden nodes, the number of passes and number of segment features being used. The results were biased in favour of speech and the measured success rate for unseen data is in excess of 95%. The software based solution is suitable for the current digital voice messaging system but it was decided to develop a stand alone ASIC based solution for future products. It has been necessary to further optimise the parameter extraction routines and the neural network to simplify the hardware functions required. The final solution uses integer arithmetic and an EPROM to store the neural network coefficients and a sigmoid function lookup table.","0537-9989","0-85296-641","10.1049/cp:19950522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=497784","","Speech processing;Voice mail;Communication system software;Real time systems;Multilayer perceptrons","speech processing;voice mail;telecommunication computing;real-time systems;multilayer perceptrons","real time speech processing;digital voice messaging systems;mobile phone users;slamdowns;empty messages;real data;standard digital processing techniques;multiperceptron artificial neural network;logical speech/nospeech result;measured success rate;unseen data;stand alone ASIC based solution;parameter extraction routines;integer arithmetic;EPROM;neural network coefficients;sigmoid function lookup table","","","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

By OPF constrains, the authors refer to the relevant active power constraints that are incorporated in the constrained economic dispatch stage (i.e. transmission capacity constraints, fuel and various regulated emission requirements). The inclusion of OPF constraints in the commitment stage will improve the feasibility of the constrained economic dispatch solution. Other unit commitment constraints such as spinning and operating reserve requirements, power balance as well as other relevant local constraints (i.e. unit ramping rates, upper and lower generation limits, minimum up and down times) are taken into account in the proposed model.

The proposed approach is suitable for both binary and multiple-class categorization problems, and can be applied as a dimensionality reduction technique. In the latter case, the number of discriminative features is determined automatically since the process of feature extraction is fully embedded in the optimization procedure. Performance tests validate our method on a number of benchmark data sets from the UCI repository, while the experiments in the application of visual object and content-based image categorization demonstrate very competitive results, asserting the method's capability of producing semantically relevant matches that share the same or synonymous vocabulary with the query category and allowing multiple pertinent category assignment.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384942","","Feature extraction;Computer vision;Data mining;Neural networks;Benchmark testing;Application software;Vocabulary;Focusing;Object detection;Linear discriminant analysis","","","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With a joint effort by NASA and TMD, a process has now been qualified to perform Parylene deposition on hybrid circuits on a production basis, for the Centaur inertial guidance computer. The Parylene coating process developed during this program consists of a) obtaining a hybrid cover with a hole in it, b) sealing of the circuit with a hole in the cover, c) Parylene coating through the hole with the external leads protected from Parylene by appropriate fixturing, and d) sealing of the hole by soldering a pretinned Kovax tab. Development of the above process required optimization of the Parylene coater parameters to obtain a uniform consistent coating which could offer adequate protection to the circuits, fixture design for packages of various types, determination of the size of the deposition hole, the amount of dimer charge per run, a process to hermetically seal the deposition holes and establishment of quality control techniques or acceptance criteria for the deposited film. Several experimental runs were made on test circuits as well as actual production circuits to determine the effect of Parylene coating on active components, thin film resistors, and wire bonds under various conditions. Tests were also made to determine if Parylene indeed protected circuits from loose particles and external environment. After these experiments, Parylene coating acceptance standards were established and a long and rigorous qualification program was completed in order to prove the feasibility of this process. The results of the qualification program will be reported in a future publication. It is concluded that Parylene offers excellent protection against loose particles and a degree of protection from some environmental conditions. It is expected that the fraction of hybrids being coated with Parylene will continue to increase in the microelectronic industry.","0361-1000;1558-2469","","10.1109/TPHP.1977.1135214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1135214","","Production;Coatings;Hybrid integrated circuits;Protection;Circuit testing;Microelectronics;Fixtures;Qualifications;Application software;Visualization","","Hybrid integrated circuit packaging;Manufacturing","","18","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We show how this algorithm can be used to efficiently compute MAP estimates for dynamically changing MRF models of labeling problems in computer vision, such as image segmentation. Specifically, given the solution of the max-flow problem on a graph, we show how to efficiently compute the maximum flow in a modified version of the graph. Our experiments showed that the time taken by our algorithm is roughly proportional to the number of edges whose weights were different in the two graphs.

Previous information-theoretic model selection criteria typically assume that data can be modelled with a parametric model of certain (possibly differing) dimension and a known error distribution. However, for mixtures of subspaces with different dimensions, a generalized notion of dimensionality is needed and hence introduced in this paper. The proposed MED criterion minimizes this geometric dimension subject to a given error tolerance (regardless of the noise distribution). Furthermore, combined with a purely algebraic approach to clustering mixtures of subspaces, namely the generalized PCA (GPCA), the MED is designed to also respect the global algebraic and geometric structure of the data. The result is a non-iterative algorithm called robust GPCA that estimates from noisy data an unknown number of subspaces with unknown and possibly different dimensions subject to a maximum error bound. We test the algorithm on synthetic noisy data and in applications such as motion/image/video segmentation.","1063-6919","0-7695-2158","10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315223","","Image segmentation;Principal component analysis;Application software;Noise robustness;Computer vision;Maximum likelihood estimation;Solid modeling;Biomedical engineering;Parametric statistics;Clustering algorithms","optimisation;principal component analysis;pattern clustering;image segmentation;algebra","minimum effective dimension;robust model selection criteria;error distribution;generalized PCA;global algebraic;geometric structure;data segmentation","","15","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Functional verification of SMP, MPP, and vector-register supercomputers through controlled randomness","J. T. Wunderlich","NA","IEEE SoutheastCon, 2003. Proceedings.","","2003","","","117","122","Prototype supercomputer functionality can be verified by comparing simulated hardware execution with actual hardware test-program runs where each successive test-program run includes randomly changing machine-states, operating scenarios, and data. Increased verification is achieved through repeated program execution. In both multiprocessor and vector-register systems, a ""controlled randomness"" can be used to verify the functionality of simultaneously executing processors or functional units. We discuss the selection and combining of random number generators such that a ""degree-of-randomness"" between successive or parallel program runs is controlled. This allows computer engineers to simulate the execution of actual software (application or system-level) in which successive or parallel program runs may or may not involve uncorrelated tasks. Additionally, random number generators are selected to maximize execution speed and cycle-length, ensure reproducibility, and when desired, best produce a random source of numbers (i.e., to better approximate an independent, identically-distributed source). Generators can also be chosen for ease of implementation, the ability to run backwards, and the ability to split the generator's cycle into uncorrelated segments. ""Backward multipliers"" to allow generators to be run in reverse can also be easily found for some types of generators; reversibility is critical for functional verification so that code execution can be traced backwards to find scenarios that led to detected hardware failures. When generators are carefully selected and combined, the verification process can be optimized. By using this methodology, functional verification of SMP, MPP and vector-register supercomputers can be achieved.","","0-7803-7856","10.1109/SECON.2003.1268440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268440","","Supercomputers;Hardware;Testing;Random number generation;Virtual prototyping;Control systems;Diversity reception;Control engineering computing;Concurrent computing;Computational modeling","parallel machines;random number generation;parallel programming;digital simulation;program verification;vector processor systems","functional verification;symmetric multiprocessing;parallel programs;massively parallel processing;vector-register supercomputers;controlled randomness;random number generators","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most industrial systems are sequentially controlled because materials and parts are processed and constructed step by step. A new method of sequential control is needed to increase productivity, and a new technique to schedule the start time of each process is also needed because of frequent adjustment of production lines and their equipment. Intelligent devices such as intelligent sensors and actuators used in the latest industrial systems have embedded high-performance processors and contain software modules. These devices cooperate and control processing robots and production lines. Advanced sequential control is proposed for sequential control systems consisting of distributed software modules. Processing time can be minimized and productivity increased by intelligent scheduling for advanced sequential control, and this paper describes a new method for adjusting the starting times of production processes automatically. This method shortens the time margin and decreases the total processing time. This paper also describes a processing flow diagram that makes it easy to adjust the starting time of each process.

Our algorithm computes the next best view by optimizing an objective function that measures the quantity of unknown information in each of a group of potential viewpoints. The potential views are either placed uniformly around the object or are calculated from the surface normals of the occupancy grid model. To initiate the collection of new data, the optimal pose is selected from the objective function calculation. The model is incrementally updated from the information acquired in each new view. This process terminates when the number of recovered voxels ceases to increase, yielding the final model.

Researching these signals yields tests for fundamental physics theories and insight in the evolution of stars. Observing pulsars suffers from two hurdles. Typically, the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, requiring long observations and large bandwidths. Next there is dispersion, causing the pulsating signals to smear out and calls for narrow signal bands. Using many parallel narrow signal bands resolves this dilemma. Traditionally, pulsar machines use tens of parallel (analog) heterodyne receivers. Though impractical, it is desirable to have many more receivers. PuMa, the first Dutch pulsar machine, uses digital signal processing to split the incoming signal into thousands of narrow bands. The processor based design also increases loading the appropriate software into the signal processors. In total 192 SHARC processors (ADSP 21062) deliver the processing capacity.

The algorithm is based on the extraction of gate connectivity information during generation of the Boolean formula from the circuit, and its use in the inner loop of a branch-and-bound SAT algorithm. The motivation for this optimization is to exploit the circuit structure information, which can be used to find unobservable gates at circuit outputs under dynamic conditions. It has the potential to speed up all applications of SAT in which the SAT formula is derived from a logic circuit. In particular, we find that it has considerable impact on an image computation algorithm based on SAT. We present practical results for benchmark circuits which show that the use of this optimization consistently improves the performance for reachability analysis, in some cases enabling the prototype tool to reach more states than otherwise possible.","0738-100X","1-58113-297","10.1145/378239.379018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935566","","Computer applications;Automatic test pattern generation;Reachability analysis;Very large scale integration;Application software;National electric code;Logic circuits;Permission;Decision making;Logic gates","Boolean functions;computability;tree searching;logic gates;VLSI;circuit CAD;logic CAD;reachability analysis;formal verification","inactive clauses;SAT;Boolean satisfiability problem;gate connectivity information;branch-and-bound SAT algorithm;circuit structure information;unobservable gates;circuit outputs;logic circuit;image computation algorithm;benchmark circuits;reachability analysis;dynamic detection","","12","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Dynamic split: flexible border between instruction and data cache","P. Trancoso","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus","8th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'05)","","2005","","","476","483","Current microprocessors are optimized for the average use. Nevertheless, it is known that different applications impose different demands on the system. This work focuses on the reconfiguration of the first-level caches. In order to achieve good performance, the first-level cache is split physically into two parts, one for instruction and one for data. This separation has the benefit of avoiding interference between instructions and data. Nevertheless, this separation is strict and determined at design-time. In this work we show a cache design that is able to change the split dynamically at runtime. The proposed design was tested using simulation of a variety of benchmark applications from the MiBench suite on two baseline architectures: embeddedXScale and high-end PowerPC. The results show that, while the average misses rate reduction may seem small; certain applications show a benefit larger than 90%. For miss rate reduction, the dynamic split cache seems to be more relevant for the cache with the smaller associativity (PowerPC). Lastly, the dynamic split cache was also used to reduce the energy consumption without loss of performance. This feature resulted in a significant energy reduction and the results showed that it has a bigger impact for the caches with larger associativity (42% energy reduction for the XScale and 28% for the PowerPC for a large data set size).","","0-7695-2433","10.1109/DSD.2005.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1559842","","Energy consumption;Microprocessors;Computer science;Application software;Interference;Runtime;Benchmark testing;Performance loss;Cache memory;Energy efficiency","microprocessor chips;cache storage;embedded systems;computer architecture","microprocessors;first-level caches design;MiBench suite;baseline architecture;embeddedXScale;high-end PowerPC;dynamic split cache;energy consumption","","1","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results for fully configured systems, using measured data rather than scaled data from smaller configurations, show that the Y-MP/8 is faster than the 64 k CM-2 for all three codes. A simple model that accounts for the relative characteristic computational speeds of the two machines, and reduction in overall CM-2 performance due to communication or SIMD conditional execution, accurately predicts the performance of two of the three codes.

Important features of this method include a model approximating the reactive power flow through a load-tap-changing (LTC) transformer and a Norton's equivalent circuit model approximating the reactive power output of a regulating generator. As a result of the linear models developed, optimally ordered triangular factorization is fully exploited to enhance computational speed and efficiency.

Thus, the evaluation of the problem functions is essentially a 'black box' operation as far as the optimization algorithm is concerned, which is the most convenient with large real systems such as electrical networks.

We first show that if the camera undergoes pure translation (unknown direction and magnitude), the epipolar geometry can be recovered from the apparent contours without using any search or optimisation process. The extracted epipolar geometry is next used for reconstructing curved surfaces from the deformations of the apparent contours viewed from uncalibrated cameras. The result is applied to distinguishing curved surfaces from fixed features in images. It is also shown that the time-to-contact to the curved surfaces can be computed from simple measurements of the apparent contours.

While this was neither a formal nor a scientific treatment of the subject, the results of the initial experiment were overwhelmingly impressive. Using the GroupSystems Electronic Meeting System (EMS), sixteen teenagers grappled with the issue of school violence and generated more than 800 different ways to predict, prevent, avoid, protect, react, eliminate, or cope with youth violence. After brainstorming for ideas, they also used EMS to categorize, prioritize, and to reach consensus about their best ideas. Then they developed teen recommendations for students, parents, teachers, school administrators, and law enforcement officers. This was all accomplished in two EMS sessions; and none of the students had any prior knowledge or experience with EMS. This report presents a synopsis of their findings and a brief description of the EMS process.","","0-7695-0001","10.1109/HICSS.1999.772733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=772733","","Medical services;Educational institutions;Protection;Law enforcement;Software systems;Productivity;Testing;Meetings","group decision support systems;social aspects of automation;teleconferencing","GroupSystems electronic meeting system;school violence;computer-aided group decision support tools;brainstorming","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distinguishing between the two genres has proved difficult because of their large intra-class variation. In addition to image metrics used in prior cartoon-classification work, we introduce novel metrics like ones based on the pattern spectrum of parabolic size distributions derived from parabolic granulometries and the complexity of the image signal approximated by its compression ratio. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature set for classification (using support vector machines) on a large set of keyframes from the TREC-2002 video track collection and a set of Web images.

The detector elements are CdTe diodes mounted on a thermoelectric cooler, providing low noise and good charge transport with relatively simple electronics. It is anticipated that the detector will have a resolution of < 1% FWHM at 662 keV with a volume of at least 0.5 cm/sup 3/ and that the approach will be suitable for production.

In this paper, we present a study of image comparison metrics for quantifying the magnitude of difference between visualization of a computer simulation and a photographic image captured from an experiment. We examined eleven metrics, including three spatial domain, four spatial-frequency domain and four HVS (human-vision system) metrics. Among these metrics, a spatial-frequency domain metric called 2nd-order Fourier comparison was proposed specifically for this work. Our study consisted of two stages: base cases and field trials. The former is a general study on a controlled comparison space using purposely selected data, and the latter involves imagery results from computational fluid dynamics and a rheological experiment. This study has introduced a methodological framework for analyzing image-level methods used in comparative visualization. For the eleven metrics considered, it has offered a set of informative indicators as to the strengths and weaknesses of each metric. In particular, we have identified three image comparison metrics that are effective in separating ""similar"" and ""different"" image groups. Our 2nd-order Fourier comparison metric has compared favorably with others in two of the three tests, and has shown its potential to be used for steering computer simulation quantitatively.","","0-7803-7498","10.1109/VISUAL.2002.1183790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183790","","Visualization;Computer simulation;Rheology;Application software;Humans;Computer graphics;Image processing;Computer vision;Design optimization;Lighting","data visualisation;digital simulation;computational fluid dynamics;rheology;image processing","visualization;comparative evaluation;computational steering;image comparison metrics;computer simulation;photographic image;spatial domain metrics;spatial-frequency domain metrics;human vision system metrics;2nd-order Fourier comparison;base cases;field trials;controlled comparison space;imagery;computational fluid dynamics;rheological experiment","","12","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Storage restrictions of small devices can be solved by using external servers to store and manage data. We have developed and tested a novel versatile digital architecture (VDA) to design inexpensive, but very flexible devices for mobile ubiquitous computing. A single VDA compliant device can be used as a mobile phone, video player, database, etc. In contrast to state of the art architectures, our approach offers new key facilities such as application download on demand and on-the-fly update of hardware acceleration components. These updates can be controlled by an external server or by the client itself. Furthermore we are able to monitor any internal signal of hardware components remotely for error detection and performance optimization.

Extensive experimentation using a multi-dimensional file structure, the BANG file, indicates that our method results in good performance for all data distributions.

Most agent paradigms overlook real-time requirements and computing resource constraints. We discuss the application of agent based computing to RoboCup and examine methods to improve it. In particular, we discuss the incorporation of a meta-level reasoning mechanism that handles individual agent organization, plan generation, task allocation, integration and plan execution. We also propose an architecture where a meta-agent is further enhanced by combining it with system-level resource allocation and optimization.

Modeling follows the process of mechanical assembly by putting together constructional components in 3-D space. Models of devices are of sufficient physical and electrical accuracy to test unmodified controller programs in a virtual commissioning phase to save time at the real start-up. In emulation, real controllers connect to the model to test and optimize control programs. In contrast to conventional discrete event simulation software, developers can play with the model during simulation to test its reaction and perform event of fault analysis. Simulation results are suited to secure design decisions of planners and reduce the risk of incorrect planning. Easy to recognize 3-D geometry and simulation interactivity qualify models for presentation and personnel training. Finally, simulation reveals suboptimal behavior and makes optimizations easier.","1050-4729","0-7803-8232","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1302538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302538","","Emulation;Testing;Discrete event simulation;Solid modeling;Machinery production industries;Production facilities;Production systems;Service robots;Orbital robotics;Robotics and automation","","","","6","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A procedure for the optimization of the multi-dwell parameters (number of dwells, dwell lengths, thresholds) to achieve minimum acquisition time is introduced and enforced. The effects of fading, interchip interference, frequency offset, multiple-access interference, and noise are taken into account in the determination of false alarm and detection probabilities. In particular, anomalous interchip interference despreading and internal interference cancellation effects are described.

The second algorithm is based on energy minimization techniques. The data are represented by a weak-membrane or thin-plate model, and a global optimization procedure is used to find a stable surface shape. Both of these algorithms have undergone extensive testing at bathymetric processing centers to assess performance. The algorithms were found to have a probability of detection high enough to be useful and a false-alarm rate that does not significantly degrade the data quality.

It focuses on designing real-time command and control or battle management systems for parallel and distributed architectures. Due to delays in other ARPA programs, the targeted architectures were not available during the time frame of the study. The results of the study were, however, tested on more conventional sequential and parallel platforms. The design method discussed here is fundamentally different from those assumed by current real-time scheduling theories, e.g., rate-monotonic, earliest-deadline-first, least-laxity or best-effort. These theories assume that the fundamental unit of prioritization is the task. In this new method, the fundamental unit of prioritization is called a work item. Work items are functions the system performs that have timing requirements (deadlines) associated with them in the requirements specification. Current scheduling theories are applied using artifact deadlines introduced by designers whereas this new method schedules work items to meet specification deadlines (sometimes called end-to-end deadlines) required by the user. With this method, tasks have no priorities. A collection of tasks with no priorities will be called a collection of peer tasks. The study showed that it is possible to schedule work items based on importance rather than urgency while still meeting as many work item deadlines as can be met by scheduling tasks with respect to urgency. Also, it showed that the minimum on-line deadline that can be guaranteed for a work item of highest importance, scheduled at run-time, is approximately the inverse of the throughput, measured in work items per second, for a work load consisting only of work items of that type. Further, it was shown that it provides optimal utilization of a single processor machine, and that its timing behavior is predictable (provable) for both single and multiprocessor machines. Finally, it was shown that throughput is not degraded during overload.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-7099","10.1109/WPDRTS.1995.470511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=470511","","Design methodology;Timing;Throughput;Peer to peer computing;Real time systems;Command and control systems;Delay effects;Sequential analysis;Processor scheduling;Runtime","delays;processor scheduling;parallel architectures;real-time systems;command and control systems","peer tasking design method;real-time command and control;battle management systems;distributed architectures;parallel architectures;real-time scheduling;work item;timing requirements;end-to-end deadlines;multiprocessor","","2","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In colloidal computing, simple per computational particles are dispersed into a communication medium which is inexpensive, (perhaps) unreliable, yet sufficiently fast. This type of clustering into computationally intensive kernels with loose inter-particle communication, but tight intra-particle communication is typical not only for the underlying hardware, but also for the actual application which runs on it. We believe that the colloidal model is appropriate to describe the next generation of embedded systems. For these systems, a significantly better design quality can be obtained via run-time trade-offs and application-driven adaptability, as opposed to classical systems where optimizations are sought in a rather static manner.","","0-7695-1561","10.1109/ISQED.2002.996787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996787","","Clocks;Application software;Kernel;Hardware;Computer architecture;Physics computing;Switches;Embedded computing;Design engineering;Embedded system","embedded systems;asynchronous circuits;computation theory;digital computers","electronic design quality;colloidal computing model;run-time trade-offs;application-driven adaptability;design feasibility;energy-performance trade-offs;embedded systems;computationally intensive kernels;loose inter-particle communication;tight intra-particle communication;asynchronous design","","4","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new approach is based on a temporal parametrization of the state variables so that the problem can be seen as an optimal time one. The most advanced technique for path planning using the C-space representation has been applied and a parallel graph search algorithm has been developed with the aim of carrying out this task with a low computational cost.

Fung","NA; NA","IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","","1980","15","1","97","116","Continuing technological advances in single-chip intelligence and storage cell density, and in bulk store performance provide increasing opportunities to construct multiple microprocessor systems. The objective of this experimental study was to explore the performance of selected system architectures in a manner sufficiently detailed, quantitative and realistic to 1) contribute to our understanding of the fundamental behavior of such systems and 2) permit practical designs to follow from the results. Four different classes of system architecture were studied: System I-fully connected; System II-bused with private primary store; System III-bused with both public and private primary store; and System IV-a uniprocessor system. All multiple-processor configurations comprised autonomous computing units which were loosely coupled with parallel links, and performed dedicated functions in a cooperative tasking environment. At the time the study began much of the anticipated technology was not yet available so detailed deterministic models of the systems were developed. All testing was done using a specially developed discrete simulation tool called the System-State Model (SSM). Both hardware and software details, derived from an operational system, were included in each model structure to represent the necessary concurrent, hierarchical, and ranked activity. A basic, interactive data base task was used as the test case. Experimental parameters included number of users, task load, console channel and bulk store channel configurations, and secondary store access time regimes. Over one hundred simulation runs were made which provided both internal and external performance measurements. Analysis of the results revealed a complex set of performance relationships which, in turn, led to several fundamental assessments. These include 1) every configuration can have its performance severely limited by the presence of any one of several key factors, 2) bulk store access time regimes and channel configuration have a critical effect on all system architectures, 3) performance distinctions among systems become more pronounced with increased number of users and with task load, and 4) each of Systems II, III, and IV manifests unique and useful performance characteristics and could be the configuration of choice under the right conditions. Overall, the results provide detailed confirmation of the utility of such systems and suggest a variety of specific tradeoffs among the architectures.","0018-9200;1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.1980.1051343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1051343","","Microprocessors;Buffer storage;Real time systems;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;System testing;Hardware;Measurement;Performance analysis","","Computer architecture;Microcomputers","","","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The methodology used applies to medical screening in general.; The results of the mathematical investigation presented in this paper include a new formula for the cost of a screening session, a probabilistic model of rebooking appointments, a model of attendance probability as a function of previous performance, and a heuristic cost optimization procedure.; Breast Test Wales have improved efficiency by introducing heavily overbooked sessions for patients who are unlikely to attend. We use simulation modelling and insights from probability theory to confirm the gain achieved by the Wales procedure and to assess the further gain achievable by optimization of appointment scheduling. It is found that a gain in throughput of at least 10% can be obtained by optimizing appointment scheduling for screening sessions, in particular by inviting patients in decreasing order of attendance probability, and by overbooking near the end of the session. This avoids the need to set up dedicated sessions for poor attenders. Another possibility is to book patients who change their appointment time, and who are therefore very likely to attend, into dedicated sessions.; The provision of appointment scheduling software with a built‐in simulation and optimization module along the lines described in this paper could enable radiographers to tailor appointment scheduling for each area and so to schedule appointments very efficiently.","1471-678X;1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/13.4.225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8132225","medical screening;scheduling;breast cancer;simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals & Magazines"

Thirty-Fifth IAS Annual Meeting and World Conference on Industrial Applications of Electrical Energy (Cat. No.00CH37129)","","2000","1","","563","568 vol.1","The power consumption of large precipitators can be in the range of one MW and above. Depending on the dust load properties, the electrical power may be reduced by up to 50% by applying fuzzy logic, without significantly increasing the dust emissions. The new approach using fuzzy logic is an optimisation of the existing precipitator. Software running on a standard personal computer platform under Windows NT facilitates the reduction in power usage. The controllers of the electrostatic precipitator power supplies are linked to the computer via an industrial network (e.g. PROFIBUS). The system determines online the differentials of emission versus electrical power of each field. This measurement is difficult because of overlaid events in the other zones, and process changes. The long response time of the resultant dust emission due to electrical power changes in the precipitator is an additional complication. Rules were defined for a coarse, but fast response power adaptation of all zones. Fine tuning the running system after the coarse optimization increased the accuracy and reliability. When installed on a 4 by 5 zone precipitator in a power station meaningful results can be obtained. The power savings over 3 months of operation were 40% to 60% depending on the load and fuel characteristics. Data was recorded over the test period of 3 months.

Such details should not be consequential in behavioural descriptions. On the other hand, describing correct and efficient hardware structures in VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language), or generally in any high-level description language, is more a question of description style than correct language statements. Therefore, more or less conscious choices are made in the design description itself that guide the synthesis software toward a specific implementation. The best implementation is also dependent on the target technology and, therefore, there is no single best description style for all FSMs. The paper is a study of the kind of performance trade-offs that can be made by changing the description style. A program is shown to be able to generate these different descriptions from an intermediate format (kiss2) describing the FSM. Therefore, this process for finding a better description could be automated and performed by the synthesis software itself. Descriptions are tested on a set of 13 FSMs most from a benchmark suite LGSynth3. The results show at least two times better performance of speed or area in the best description compared with the worst. In performance critical applications this difference can be of a crucial importance.","1350-2387","","10.1049/ip-cdt:20010210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915281","","","hardware description languages;finite state machines;high level synthesis","VHDL synthesis;finite state machine;state assignment;state vector encoding;combinational logic optimisation;high-level description language;FSM","","13","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Based on the known physics of first-order sea scatter at HF, these techniques, implemented as software, are objective and automatic in that they: a) determine from the sea-echo phase and amplitude correction factors for the antenna elements; b) separate the first-order spectrum from the surrounding continuum for arbitrarily varying current conditions; c) using statistical hypothesis testing, select and use either a single or dual-angle model for radial current patterns, whichever best fits the data; d) calculate angles associated with given radial velocities; e) combine the data into a polar-coordinate map of radial velocity versus position; and f) calculate radial velocity uncertainties at each point on the map. In addition, as interpretive aids, two methods are evaluated and compared that provide total current vectors from single-site CODAR data, along with their uncertainties: model fitting and the application of the equation of continuity. It is shown how these methods can be applied to the older, CODAR 4-element antenna system, however, the following advantages of the crossed-loop/monopole system are discussed: it is physically more compact; analysis procedures are more efficient; resulting current velocities are more accurate, because there are no side-lobe problems; and finally, it also gives the ocean wave-height directional spectrum. These methods are tested and optimized against data taken during the Atlantic Remote Sensing Land Ocean Experiment (ARSLOE) storm (October 23-27, 1980), when surface currents varied in speed between 0-50 cm/s and over nearly 300° in angle. Current velocities were measured to a range of 36 km from the radar. Standard deviations in angle are typically 1°-3°; these translate to 2-3 cm/s rms radial velocity uncertainties over most of the coverage area, with decreased accuracy in angular sectors nearest the coast. Total current velocity vectors in strips parallel to shore obtained from model fitting have typical speed and angle uncertainties of 4 cm/s and 12°, respectively. Of the several formulations for the equation of continuity evaluated here, the best gave uncertainties of 5 cm/s, 12° at the closest range cells; these values increase rapidly with range to exceed 20 cm/s, 30° for distances greater than 20 km. The surface currents were observed to follow the wind throughout most of the storm at ARSLOE, but the current was almost always more closely parallel to the shore than the wind. An interesting exception occurred when the onshore storm wind that had prevailed for two days ceased; there was a rush of surface current directly offshore as the storm-surge sea level dropped. The surface current speed measured by CODAR in the upper meter of the ocean was, on the average, 2.1 percent of the windspeed.","0364-9059;1558-1691;2373-7786","","10.1109/JOE.1983.1145578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1145578","","Data mining;Sea surface;Oceans;Uncertainty;Sea measurements;Storms;Application software;Radar antennas;Equations;Current measurement","","HF radar;Least-squares approximation;Radar antennas;Sea surface electromagnetic scattering","","154","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

International Conference on","","2004","","","361","366","The presence of multiple active threads on the same processor can mask latency by rapid context switching, but it can adversely affect performance due to competition for shared datapath resources. In this paper we present Macro Software Pipelining (MSWP), a loop scheduling technique for multithreaded processors, which is based on the loop distribution transformation for loop pipelining. MSWP constructs loop schedules by partitioning the loop body into tasks and assigning each task to a thread that executes all iterations for that particular task. MSWP is applied top-down on a hierarchical program representation, and utilizes thread-level speculation for maximal exploitation of parallelism. We tested MSWP on a multithreaded architectural model, Coral 2000, using synthetic and SPEC benchmarks. We obtained speedups of up to 30% with respect to highly optimized superblock-based schedules on loops with unpredictable branches, and a speedup of up to 25% on perl, a highly sequential SPEC95 integer benchmark.","","0-7695-2080","10.1109/PCEE.2004.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376782","","Processor scheduling;Pipeline processing;Yarn;Parallel processing;Delay;Benchmark testing;Switches;Data engineering;Registers;Hardware","","","","1","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researching these signals yields tests for fundamental physics theories and insight in the evolution of stars. To carry out pulsar observations, two hurdles have to be overcome. Typically, the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, requiring long observations and large bandwidths. Next there is dispersion, causing the pulsating signals to smear out and calls for narrow signal bands. Using many parallel narrow signal bands resolves this dilemma. Traditionally, pulsar machines use tens of parallel (analog) heterodyne receivers. Though impractical, it is desirable to have many more receivers. PuMa, the first Dutch pulsar machine, uses digital signal processing to split the incoming signal in up to thousands of narrow bands. The processor based design also increases flexibility as it allows different observational modes by loading the appropriate software into the signal processors. In total 192 SHARC processors (ADSP 21062) deliver the processing capacity. For PuMa a general purpose 6-processor SHARC board was developed, optimized for concurrent use of data busses. Other parts are commercially available components and all is joined in a VME environment.

Selection of representative commercial workloads and identification of key characteristics to be evaluated. 2. Collection of performance data. Various instrumentation techniques are discussed in light of the requirements placed by commercial server workloads on the instrumentation. 3. Creation of input data for performance models on the basis of measured workload information.

Creation of performance models. Two general types are described: high-level models and detailed cycle-accurate simulators. These types are applied to model the processor, memory, and I/O system. 5. System performance optimization. The tuning of the operating system and application software is described. Optimization of performance among commercial applications is not simply an exercise in using traces to maximize the processor MIPS. Equally significant are items such as the use of probabilities to reflect future workload characteristics, software tuning, cache miss rate optimization, memory management, and I/O performance.

To make the code generation tool retargetable, we first developed a versatile coding constraint model to faithfully characterize the target machine's limitations on hardware resource, pipeline execution and other specific instruction usage. Second, since loop executions account for most of the time consumption, the software pipelining technique was employed to overlap the execution of successive iterations. To generate efficient code for real time applications, a simulated evolution (SE) based code generation module was introduced to derive the steady state loop scheduling. Effective heuristics subject to various coding constraints were developed. In addition, to alleviate the scheduling overhead in checking coding/resource constraints repetitively, bit-parallel verification schemes was devised as well.

Yet traditional visibility culling algorithms were mainly designed for static data, without consideration of such potential temporal coherency. We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence-based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block. Then POFs need only be computed for these representative blocks. To quickly determine the subvolumes that do not require updates in their visibility status for each subsequent time step, a hierarchical ""TOC tree"" data structure is constructed to store the spans of coherent time steps. To achieve maximal culling potential, while remaining conservative, we have extended our previous POP into an optimized POP (OPOP) encoding scheme for this specific scenario. To test our general TOC and OPOF approach, we have designed a parallel time-varying volume rendering algorithm accelerated by visibility culling. Results from experimental runs on a 32-processor cluster confirm both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.","","0-7803-8788","10.1109/VISUAL.2004.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372191","visibility culling;time-varying data visualization;volume rendering;plenoptic opacity function;large data visualization","Data visualization;Computational modeling;Computer graphics;Algorithm design and analysis;Acceleration;Rendering (computer graphics);Clustering algorithms;Large-scale systems;Laboratories;Iterative algorithms","data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics);temporal databases;tree data structures","visibility culling;time-varying volume rendering;temporal occlusion coherence;iterative scientific software simulation;plenoptic opacity functions;tree data structure;parallel algorithm;data visualization","","1","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, two step-up non insulated DC/DC converter topologies, suitable to equip low power fuel cell power units are developed and deeply examined. A key feature of the two proposed converters is that they are obtained by mixing some basic topologies, in order to optimize both duty cycle and the winding ratio. Moreover, multichannel interleaved power conversion structures are adopted in order to reduce the size of input and output filters.

This was accomplished without losing the now familiar semicustom design attributes of `first-time success′, coupled with facilities for the user to complete his own design. The full features of the Megacell design system are described, and projections are made of how its capabilities will be extended as CMOS technology edges towards 1 μm. The provision of a series of cell structures of increasing complexity within Megacell allows the user to optimise his layout, without inducing the uncharacterised variations that would be usual in a full custom design. The cell structure has within it three major types: microcells which are the low-level logic cells found in most array or cell design systems; paracells which are cells of high functional capability, compiled by user software specifically for the customer's application. The paracell is created from parameters, input by the user, as he designs his circuit; and supracells which have the highest complexity and are cells that replicate the function of today's LSI standard products. They include not only digital functions, such as microprocessors, but also analogue blocks such as A/D and D/A convenors. The heart of the Megacell design system is its CAD.

The target architecture is a 2-D array of processing elements for low-level image processing. An array is divided into subarrays called chips. At the chip level, defect tolerance is proved by an extra column of PEs (processing element) and bypassing techniques. At the wafer level, a double-rail connection network is used to construct a target array of defect-free chips that is as large and as fast as possible. Its main advantage is being independent of chip defects, as it is controlled from the I/O pads. An algorithm for constructing an optimized two-dimensional array on a wafer containing a given number of defect-free PEs and connections, a method to program the switches for the target architecture found by the algorithm, and software for programming the switches using laser cuts are discussed.<<ETX>>","0018-9162;1558-0814","","10.1109/2.129043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=129043","","Switches;Read-write memory;Wafer scale integration;Testing;Circuits;Transistors;Silicon;Image processing;Pixel;Filtering","computerised picture processing;fault tolerant computing;parallel architectures","ELSA;wafer-scale architectures;target architecture;low-level image processing;double-rail connection network;target array;defect-free chips","","13","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Space Solar Power Workshop (SSPW) http://classweb.gatech.edu/conf/sspw/ was created as a cooperative software and hardware development forum to better understand the SSP engineering and business model. It exists, to educate the interested public about this SSP opportunity. The SSPW intends to develop a straw business plan for transitioning to SSP power generation and delivery to client power grids. These goals include determining the costs resulting from various design assumptions. They transcend software and hardware development challenges to provide an open forum for the exchange of software and ideas which impact SSP design prototyping and optimization. Currently, we are developing design criteria and standardization paradigms that serve as interfaces among the developing component systems. Without more experience in developing SSP software, hardware, and procedures, designers are challenged to design and interface to other components some of which have not yet been designed, built, or GEO flight tested.

Liquid droplets of lithium were delivered into the edge of TFTR plasmas at low velocities in order to coat the interior of the TFTR vacuum vessel, and study the effects on machine performance. A 1.6 Joule 1064 nm, 30 Hz pulsed YAG laser was used to form droplets from a heated cauldron containing liquid lithium. The cauldron was resistance heated and part of a new probe head attached to the existing Bay D Long Probe. The cauldron was moved into the bottom of the vacuum vessel and positioned in the shadow of a poloidal limiter. The laser, associated equipment, and beam expanding optics were located in a walled enclosure approximately 46 m from the cauldron. Three fixed mirrors directed the beam through the test cell wall and into a box containing the focusing optics, steering mirror and a remote viewing CID video camera system. The focused beam was aimed vertically downward through a vacuum window and into the lithium cauldron. The system was controlled using LabView/sup TM/ software. Safety issues were resolved with engineered hardware design, interlocked circuits and administrative control. Lithium was successfully introduced into TFTR. Some interesting physics results were obtained. There was insufficient time to optimize the operation and design but initial results point to interesting possibilities for future experiments.

Konen","ZN GmbH, Germany","IEEE Expert","","1996","11","4","7","8","One of the challenges of neural information processing is to achieve, at least partially, a similar performance to humans on systems for automated visual face recognition. Commercial applications of new technology don't care about the underlying architecture or paradigms. The architecture simply needs to work all the time and be easy to use. That was the essence of ZN's product design plan when we began developing our ZN-Face access control system. ZN-Face relies on von der Malsburg's graph matching, which is robust enough to deal with the low quality pictures encountered outside the laboratory when developing automated image acquisition from real world scenes. (In this way, of course, the underlying neural system's robustness is essential, because otherwise we could not have fulfilled the works-all-the-time requirement.) At ZN, we developed the complete hardware and software setup for the biometric access control device. We optimized and adapted the algorithms to the specific verification task-that is, ""is the person in question identical to the cardholder?""and tested it in the hardware setup, leading to a 99.5% performance verification rate. As with most face recognizers, ZN-Face requires the cooperation of users, who must orient their heads toward the camera during picture acquisition (/spl plusmn/15/spl deg/). Today's algorithms can only partially solve the challenge of generalizing from, for example, a half profile view to a frontal view.","0885-9000;2374-9407","","10.1109/64.511769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=511769","","Information processing;Face recognition;Zinc;Access control;Robust control;Hardware;Humans;Product design;Laboratories;Layout","face recognition;feature extraction;biometrics (access control);neural nets","neural information processing;automated visual face recognition;product design plan;ZN-Face access control system;graph matching;low quality pictures;automated image acquisition;real world scenes;biometric access control device;verification task;performance verification rate;face recognizers;picture acquisition;real world face recognition applications","","2","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this reason, an Airborne SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter System (ASIRAS) is currently under development in the frame of an ESA contract. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, several components, i.e. the chirp generator, are critical and therefore require innovative solutions. A dedicated software performs SAR- and interferometric radar data processing and, in addition, supports internal instrument calibration.

The physical effects being at stake are completely different, but in each of these examples, they originate from a region thin in regard with the other geometrical dimensions. An efficient numerical approach consists on using a surfacic representation with special boundary conditions expressing the solution inside the thin region. We propose in that paper a didactical approach to thin regions in electromanetics and, as an example, the boundary conditions and surfacic equation for eddy currents flowing inside a thin ferromagnetic shell. The numerical tests are done using the BEM software PH13D, but the results could easily be transposed in a FEM context.

The drive system hardware includes the implementation of microprocessor system, transistorized inverter, interface circuits, isolating circuits and driving circuits. The IGBTs are used as efficient switching devices for the inverter power circuits, so simple and efficient transistor drive circuits can be used. Also, the overlap protection is taken into consideration. The PWM inverter is to feed an induction motor with adjustable voltage to frequency in a proper relation to maintain approximately constant rated flux in the machine over the operating frequency range (1-50 Hz). Hence, the drive system is used to control the speed of a three-phase induction motor from very low speed to the motor rated speed at a constant torque. The test results were obtained experimentally.

Water inflow forecasting into the head hydro power plant (HPP) reservoir is one of most important inputs to the cascade hydro system (CHS) optimization process. Ability to properly forecast the increase of natural inflow can result in increased electric energy production due to enhanced flexibility in stored water management. Due to the Soca river torrential character two separate algorithms for short term and mid term water inflow forecasting are designed. Short term water inflow forecasting is based on precipitation data collected by the ombrometer stations in the river basin and is used for forecasts up to 6 hours ahead. The efficacy of the proposed method is tested for a practical case and some results are presented. Mid term water inflow forecasting is based on the forecasted precipitation data and is capable of predicting water inflows for the next two days.

It allows system engineers to develop their own custom integrated circuits. The challenge of Megacell was to create a design system that would exploit fully the low-power and high-speed performance of a UK developed 2 μm CMOS technology, while producing the silicon utilisation efficiency typical of full custom design. This was accomplished without losing the now familiar semicustom design attributes of `first-time success', coupled with facilities for the user to complete his own design. The full features of the Megacell design system are described, and projections are made of how its capabilities will be extended as CMOS technology edges towards 1 μm. The provision of a series of cell structures of increasing complexity within Megacell allows the user to optimise his layout, without inducing the uncharacterised variations that would be usual in a full custom design. The cell structure has within it three major types: microcells which are the low-level logic cells found in most array or cell design systems; paracells which are cells of high functional capability, compiled by user software specifically for the customer's application. The paracell is created from parameters, input by the user, as he designs his circuit; and supracells which have the highest complexity and are cells that replicate the function of today's LSI standard products.

Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA; Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA; Dept. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA","Proceedings. 42nd Design Automation Conference, 2005.","","2005","","","684","689","We propose a system architecture for real-time hardware speech recognition on low-cost, power-constrained devices. The system is intended to support real-time speech-based user interfaces as part of an effort to bring information and communication technologies (ICTs) to underdeveloped regions of the world. Our system architecture exploits a shared infrastructure model. The computationally intensive task of speech model training and retraining is performed offline by shared servers, while the actual recognition of speech is conducted on low-cost hand-held devices using custom hardware. The recognizer is extremely flexible and can support multiple languages or dialects with speaker-independent recognition. Dynamic loading of speech models is used for changing language grammar and retraining, while reprogramming is used to support evolution of recognition algorithms. The focus on small sets of words (at one time) reduces the complexity, cost and power consumption. We design the speech decoder, the central component of the recognizer, and we validate it via a prototype FPGA implementation. We then use ASIC synthesis to estimate power and size for the design. Our evaluations demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in power compared with optimized recognition software running on a low-power embedded general-purpose processor of the same technology and of similar capabilities. The synthesis also estimates the area of the design to be about 2.5mm, showing potential for lower cost. In designing and testing our recognizer we use datasets in both English and Tamil languages.","0738-100X","1-59593-058","10.1145/1065579.1065760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510419","","Hardware;Speech recognition;User interfaces;Costs;Natural languages;Computer architecture;Real time systems;Power system modeling;Communications technology;Handheld computers","speech recognition;user interfaces;application specific integrated circuits;vocoders;field programmable gate arrays;natural languages","speech recognition;user interface;power-constrained device;information communication technology;speech model training;hand-held device;language grammar;power consumption;speech decoder;FPGA implementation;ASIC synthesis","","16","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the extra dimension necessitates a new approach to design automation. Through experience gained in manually partitioning electronic systems, generic design rules have been formulated and implemented in software. The approach adopted is based on a genetic algorithm which can produce multiple candidate solutions and has the potential to simultaneously optimize multiple design criteria. This paper presents the initial results for the automatic configuration of a variety of systems. The results obtained by the algorithm are compared to known optimal solutions for ""test"" cases and to the results obtained by manual partitioning for the first heterogeneous MCM-V system.","0537-9989","0-85296-693","10.1049/cp:19971228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=681074","","","multichip modules","genetic algorithm;electronic packaging technology;low-cost three-dimensional multichip module technology;design automation;generic design rules;design criteria;automatic configuration;heterogeneous MCM-V system","","","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Refregier","NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","","2005","363","1","197","210","The shapelets method for image analysis is based upon the decomposition of localized objects into a series of orthogonal components with convenient mathematical properties. We extend the ‘Cartesian shapelet’ formalism from earlier work, and construct ‘polar shapelet’ basis functions that separate an image into components with explicit rotational symmetries. These frequently provide a more compact parametrization, and can be interpreted in an intuitive way. Image manipulation in shapelet space is simplified by the concise expressions for linear coordinate transformations, and shape measures (including object photometry, astrometry and galaxy morphology estimators) take a naturally elegant form. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of astronomical survey images, and we test shapelet techniques upon real data from the Hubble Space Telescope. We present a practical method to automatically optimize the quality of an arbitrary shapelet decomposition in the presence of observational noise, pixelization and a point spread function. A central component of this procedure is the adaptive choice of the scale size and the truncation order of the shapelet expansion. A complete software package to perform shapelet image analysis is made available on the World Wide Web.","0035-8711;1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09453.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8173530","methods: analytical;methods: data analysis;techniques: image processing;galaxies: fundamental parameters","","","","","8","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals & Magazines"

McGraw","NA; NA","IEEE Security & Privacy","","2004","2","4","79","84","Risk analysis is, at best, a good general-purpose yardstick by which we can judge our security design's effectiveness. Because roughly 50 percent of security problems are the result of design flaws, performing a risk analysis at the design level is an important part of a solid software security program. Taking the trouble to apply risk-analysis methods at the design level for any application often yields valuable, business-relevant results. The risk analysis process is continuous and applies to many different levels, at once identifying system-level vulnerabilities, assigning probability arid impact, arid determining reasonable mitigation strategies. The paper looks at how, by considering the resulting ranked risks, business stakeholders can determine how to manage particular risks and what the most cost-effective controls might be.","1540-7993;1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2004.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324606","software development;software design;misuse cases;abuse cases","Risk analysis;Software design;Costs;Computer security;Data security;Probability;Cryptography;Hardware;Acceleration;Life testing","risk analysis;software engineering;security","risk analysis;design-level analysis;software design;good judgement call;vulnerabilities;threats;impacts;probability","","36","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

European authorities realize that leading-edge companies in these industries must develop strong research and development in system design to maintain their leading positions. This is why the authorities ore heavily funding cooperation between industries and universities through a 2,000-million-euro (US$2,200 million) prolect called MEDEA (MicroEIectronics Development for European Applications). The goal is to master new electronic system design automation technologies, including hardware-software codesign and mixed analog/digital systems. In this roundtable, representatives of academia, industry, and European organizations evaluate the existing technologies and predict their future. The roundtable was held last March at the internotionol conference on Design and Test in Europe (DATE99) in Munich. IEEE Design & Test thanks roundtable participants Joseph Borel (STMicroelectronics), Anton Souer (MEDEA Office), Wolfgang Rosenstiel (University of Tuebingen), Frank Ghenossio (STMicroelectronics), and Ernest0 Perea (STMicroelectronics) D&Tgrotefully acknowledges the help of Ahmed Jerraya (TIMA), and Soman Adham (LogicVision) and Adam Osseiron (Fluence), who helped organize the roundtable and acted as recorders.","0740-7475;1558-1918","","10.1109/MDT.1999.808227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=808227","","Design automation;Europe;Productivity;Automotive engineering;Educational institutions;Optimizing compilers;System-on-a-chip;System-level design;Circuit testing;Silicon","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
