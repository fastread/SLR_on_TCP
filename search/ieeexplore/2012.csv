Gohner","NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation","","2012","","","483","486","Limited test time and restricted number of test resources confront test managers with big challenges, especially in the system test. Consequently, the test manager has to prioritize test cases before each test cycle. There is much information available for determining a reasonable prioritization order in software projects. However, due to the complexity of current software systems and the high number of existing test cases, the abundance of information relevant for prioritization is not manageable for the test manager, even with high effort. In this paper we present a concept for an automated prioritization of test cases using software agents and fuzzy logic. Our prioritization system determines the prioritization order which increases the test effectiveness and the fault detection rate.","2159-4848","978-0-7695-4670-4978-1-4577-1906","10.1109/ICST.2012.131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200143","test case prioritization;software agent;fuzzy logic","Software agents;Fault detection;Estimation;Fuzzy logic;Testing;Software systems","fuzzy logic;program testing;software agents;software fault tolerance","test case;software agent;fuzzy logic;test resource;system test;test manager;test cycle;prioritization order;software project;software system complexity;automated prioritization;prioritization system;test effectiveness;fault detection rate","","12","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In literature, proposed test case prioritization techniques assume a constant pool of test cases with non-changing coverage during the regression testing process, and therefore they work with a fixed, prioritized test suite. However, in practice, test cases and their coverage metrics may change during regression testing due to modifications of software artefacts (e.g. due to bug fixing). For example, modifying obsolete test cases or source code may change the coverage metrics during the process. This may lead to some changes in test case priorities. Dealing with manual tests cases, scheduling test case execution in shared environments and other constraints in practice may cause the same effect. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in industrial regression testing and propose a paradigm called Dynamic Prioritization, which uses in-process events and the most up-to-date test suite to re-order test cases.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954402","regression testing;test case prioritization;software testing","Testing;Measurement;Couplings;Software;Complexity theory;Manuals;Minimization","program testing","regression testing;test case prioritization technique;test case coverage metrics;dynamic prioritization paradigm","","3","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is inefficient to re execute all the test cases in regression testing following the software modifications. Using information obtained from previous test case execution, prioritization techniques order the test cases for regression testing so that most beneficial are executed first thus allows an improved effectiveness of testing. One performance goal, rate of dependency detected among faults, measures how quickly dependency among faults are detected within the regression testing process. An improved rate of fault dependency can provide faster feedback on software and let developers start debugging on the severe faults that cause other faults to appear later. This paper presents the new metric for assessing rate of fault dependency detection and an algorithm to prioritize test cases. Using the new metric the effectiveness of this prioritization is shown comparing it with non-prioritized test case. Analysis proves that prioritized test cases are more effective in detecting dependency among faults.","","978-1-4244-8679-3978-1-4244-8678","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941954","Software Engineering;Software Testing;Test Case Prioritization;Regression Testing;Average Percentage of Fault Dependency Detected (APFDD)","Measurement;Software;Software testing;Fault detection;Software algorithms;Debugging","computer aided software engineering;program testing;regression analysis;scheduling","test case prioritization;scheduling test;test case execution;prioritization techniques;regression testing process;fault dependency detection","","7","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regression testing is essential to avoid these problems, but it may be ended up with executing many time-consuming test cases. This paper tries to address prioritizing requirements-based regression test cases. To this end, system-level testing is focused on two practical issues in industrial environments: i) addressing multiple goals regarding quality, cost and effort in a project, and ii) using non-code metrics due to the lack of detailed code metrics in some situations. This paper reports a goal-driven practice at Research In Motion (RIM) towards prioritizing requirements-based test cases regarding these issues. Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) is adopted in identifying metrics for prioritization. Two sample goals are discussed to demonstrate the approach: detecting bugs earlier and maintaining testing effort. We use two releases of a prototype Web-based email client to conduct a set of experiments based on the two mentioned goals. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from applying the goal-driven approach and experiments, and we propose few directions for future research.","1534-5351;1534-5351","978-1-61284-259-2978-0-7695-4343","10.1109/CSMR.2011.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741354","Test case prioritization;Software regression testing;Requirements-based test cases;Goal-driven approaches","Testing;Measurement;Computer bugs;Humans;Complexity theory;Software;Electronic mail","program testing;regression analysis;software maintenance;software metrics","requirement prioritization;regression test cases;system-level testing maintenance;noncode metrics;Research In Motion;goal-question-metric;bug detection;Web-based email client","","5","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The major challenges in CBS are testing component dependency that is; it is a tricky task to test each and every component for each possible input data which will lead to exhaustive testing. To reduce the cost, the industries are following some stopping criteria and release the product to the customer side. These stopping criteria will at times lead to skipping up of some of the components from rigorous testing. This will lead to hazardous side effects such as loss in terms of revenue, human life and resources. This insight leads to the need to identify critical components which have the higher dependability measure in terms of functionality and receives higher priority in testing with rigorous test procedures. Hence, this paper proposes a novel method for identifying the critical components from the Software under Test (SUT) and prioritizes them for testing with at most care based on various dependency metrics and measures among the components with the help of Component Execution Sequence Graph (CESG).","","978-1-4577-1531-0978-1-4577-1530-3978-1-4577-1529","10.1109/MySEC.2011.6140684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6140684","Software Testing;Test prioritization;Component based Testing;Critical component;metrics and measures","Couplings;Software;Software testing;Software measurement;Programming","graph theory;object-oriented programming;program testing;real-time systems;software cost estimation;software metrics;software reusability","critical component analyzer;test prioritization framework;component based real time systems;component based software development system;reusable components;complex software system;testing component dependency;exhaustive testing;cost reduction;stopping criteria;hazardous side effects;rigorous test procedures;software under test;SUT;dependency metrics;component execution sequence graph;CESG","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the basic test selection methods is the one based on code coverage information, where only those tests are included that cover some parts of the changes. We experimentally applied this method to the open source web browser engine project WebKit to find out the technical difficulties and the expected benefits if this method is to be introduced into the actual build process. Although the principle is simple, we had to solve a number of technical issues, so we report how this method was adapted to be used in the official build environment. Second, we present results about the selection capabilities for a selected set of revisions of WebKit, which are promising.

Most of the information needed is available in the test management and error reporting systems while some is embedded in the process. Transparency is increased through a semi-automated method. Our quantitative evaluation indicates a possibility to improve efficiency, while the qualitative evaluation supports the general principles of history-based testing but suggests changes in implementation details.","2159-4848","978-1-61284-174-8978-0-7695-4342","10.1109/ICST.2011.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770626","regression testing;history-based prioritization;regression test selection;regression test prioritization;empirical evaluation;industrial case study;function testing","Testing;Software;History;Equations;Interviews;Context;Systematics","program testing;software houses","regression testing transparency;history-based prioritization;history based regression testing;regression test selection automation;large scale software development organization;manual regression testing process;test management systems;error reporting systems","","8","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These EDSs pose a challenge to testing because there are a large number of possible event sequences that users can invoke through a user interface. While valuable contributions have been made for testing these two subclasses of EDS, such efforts have been disjoint. This work provides the first single model that is generic enough to study GUI and Web applications together. In this paper, we use the model to define generic prioritization criteria that are applicable to both GUI and Web applications. Our ultimate goal is to evolve the model and use it to develop a unified theory of how all EDS should be tested. An empirical study reveals that the GUI and Web-based applications, when recast using the new model, show similar behavior. For example, a criterion that gives priority to all pairs of event interactions did well for GUI and Web applications; another criterion that gives priority to the smallest number of parameter value settings did poorly for both. These results reinforce our belief that these two subclasses of applications should be modeled and studied together.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2010.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5401169","Combinatorial interaction testing;covering arrays;event-driven software (EDS);t-way interaction coverage;test suite prioritization;user-session testing;Web application testing;GUI testing.","Software testing;Graphical user interfaces;Application software;Computer science;User interfaces;Protocols;Embedded software;Information systems;Educational institutions;Abstracts","graphical user interfaces;Internet;program testing;service-oriented architecture","event-driven software;test prioritization strategy;EDS;GUI testing;Web application testing;graphical user interface","","63","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Test case prioritization techniques improve the cost-effectiveness of regression testing by ordering test cases such that those that are more important are run earlier in the testing process. Many prioritization techniques have been proposed and evidence shows that they can be beneficial. It has been suggested, however, that the time constraints that can be imposed on regression testing by various software development processes can strongly affect the behavior of prioritization techniques. If this is correct, a better understanding of the effects of time constraints could lead to improved prioritization techniques and improved maintenance and testing processes. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to assess the effects of time constraints on the costs and benefits of prioritization techniques. Our first experiment manipulates time constraint levels and shows that time constraints do play a significant role in determining both the cost-effectiveness of prioritization and the relative cost-benefit trade-offs among techniques. Our second experiment replicates the first experiment, controlling for several threats to validity including numbers of faults present, and shows that the results generalize to this wider context. Our third experiment manipulates the number of faults present in programs to examine the effects of faultiness levels on prioritization and shows that faultiness level affects the relative cost-effectiveness of prioritization techniques. Taken together, these results have several implications for test engineers wishing to cost-effectively regression test their software systems.

Over the past few years, many test case prioritization techniques have been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques require data on dynamic execution in the form of code coverage information for test cases. However, the collection of dynamic code coverage information on test cases has several associated drawbacks including cost increases and reduction in prioritization precision. In this paper, we propose an approach to prioritizing test cases in the absence of coverage information that operates on Java programs tested under the JUnit framework-an increasingly popular class of systems. Our approach, JUnit test case Prioritization Techniques operating in the Absence of coverage information (JUPTA), analyzes the static call graphs of JUnit test cases and the program under test to estimate the ability of each test case to achieve code coverage, and then schedules the order of these test cases based on those estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of JUPTA, we conducted an empirical study on 19 versions of four Java programs ranging from 2K-80K lines of code, and compared several variants of JUPTA with three control techniques, and several other existing dynamic coverage-based test case prioritization techniques, assessing the abilities of the techniques to increase the rate of fault detection of test suites. Our results show that the test suites constructed by JUPTA are more effective than those in random and untreated test orders in terms of fault-detection effectiveness. Although the test suites constructed by dynamic coverage-based techniques retain fault-detection effectiveness advantages, the fault-detection effectiveness of the test suites constructed by JUPTA is close to that of the test suites constructed by those techniques, and the fault-detection effectiveness of the test suites constructed by some of JUPTA's variants is better than that of the test suites constructed by several of those techniques.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2011.106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363461","Software testing;regression testing;test case prioritization;JUnit;call graph","Software testing;Regression analysis;Scheduling","Java;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance","static approach;regression testing;test case prioritization techniques;dynamic code coverage information;Java programs;JUnit test case prioritization techniques operating in the absence of coverage information;JUPTA;static call graphs;fault-detection effectiveness;dynamic coverage-based techniques","","47","44","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The search for the ultimate guarantee for software quality through the introduction of automated software testing raises a more difficult question of ""quantity"" of tests necessary to ensure the best results.

Usually this test criterion corresponds to a ""coverage function"" that measures how much of the automatically generated optimization parameters satisfies the given test criterion.

This process can be treated as an optimization problem, aiming to find a subset of TCs which optimizes one or more objective functions (i.e., selection criteria). The majority of search-based works focus on single-objective selection. In this light, we developed a mechanism for functional TC selection which considers two objectives simultaneously: maximize requirements' coverage while minimizing cost in terms of TC execution effort. This mechanism was implemented as a multi-objective optimization process based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We implemented two multi-objective versions of PSO (BMOPSO and BMOPSO-CDR). The experiments were performed on two real test suites, revealing very satisfactory results (attesting the feasibility of the proposed approach).

Thus, a local search strategy algorithm is proposed generating solutions aiming at maximizing the coverage of software project characteristics and skills required by the testing team to use the techniques and minimizing the eventual effort to construct models used for test cases generation. A preliminary evaluation analyzes this new approach when compared to the Porantim's original version, and the results indicate improvements in the MBT techniques selection.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954407","software testing;model-based testing;testing techniques selection;search-based software engineering","Software;Testing;Analytical models;Software engineering;Optimization;Programming;Search problems","graph theory;optimisation;program testing;search problems","Porantim-Opt;model-based testing;software product;software project;software engineering;multiobjective combinatorial optimization;smallest dominating set;bipartite graph;weighted graph;local search strategy","","2","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Once modules are categorized as fault-prone or not fault-prone, test effort are allocated accordingly. Testing effort and efficiency are primary concern and can be optimized by prediction and ranking of fault-prone modules. This paper discusses a new model for prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules for test effort optimization. Model utilizes the classification capability of data mining techniques and knowledge stored in software metrics to classify the software module as fault-prone or not fault-prone. A decision tree is constructed using ID3 algorithm for the existing project data. Rules are derived form the decision tree and integrated with fuzzy inference system to classify the modules as either fault-prone or not fault-prone for the target data. The model is also able to rank the fault-prone module on the basis of its degree of fault-proneness. The model accuracy are validated and compared with some other models by using the NASA projects data set of PROMOSE repository.","","978-1-4244-8343-3978-1-4244-8344","10.1109/ICRESH.2010.5779531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779531","software testing;fault-prone modules;software metrics;ID3 algorithm;fuzzy inference system (FIS)","","decision trees;inference mechanisms;optimisation;program testing;software fault tolerance;software metrics;software quality","test effort optimization;fault-prone software modules;software system reliability;software system quality;software metrics;ID3 algorithm;decision tree;fuzzy inference system","","7","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As software grows, a regression test suite is run to ensure that the old functionality still works as expected. Yet, as the number of test cases increases, it becomes more expensive to execute the test suite. Reduction and prioritization techniques enable developers to manage large and unwieldy test suites. However, practitioners and researchers do not always use and study these methods due, in part, to a lack of availability. In response to this issue, this paper describes an already released open-source framework that supports both research and practice in regression testing.

In the event of a test failing, the fault at the root of the failure has to be localized, adding an extra debugging cost that has to be taken into account as well. However, test suites that are prioritized for failure detection can reduce the amount of useful information for fault localization. This deteriorates the quality of the diagnosis provided, making the subsequent debugging phase more expensive, and defeating the purpose of the test cost minimization. In this paper we introduce a new test case prioritization approach that maximizes the improvement of the diagnostic information per test. Our approach minimizes the loss of diagnostic quality in the prioritized test suite.

Therefore aspect-oriented programs can be tested in an incremental fashion - we can first test the base classes and then test the base classes and aspects as a whole. This paper demonstrates that, in this incremental testing paradigm, we can prioritize aspect tests so as to report failure earlier. We explore test prioritization for testing aspect-oriented programs against their state models with transition coverage and round-trip coverage. Aspect tests are generated from woven state models obtained by composing aspect models into their base class models. We prioritize aspect tests by identifying the extent to which an aspect modifies its base classes. The modification is measured by the number of new and changed components in state transitions (start state, event, precondition, postcondition, end state). Transitions with more changes have higher priorities for test generation. We evaluate the impact of aspect test prioritization through mutation analysis of two AspectJ programs, where all aspects and their base classes can be modeled by finite state machines. We create aspect mutants of each AspectJ program according to a comprehensive AspectJ fault model. Then we test each mutant with the test suites generated without prioritization and with prioritization, respectively.

This paper presents an optimization framework which considers the contribution of each component to system reliability to determine the amount of effort to be allocated to each component, towards the ultimate objective of achieving the specified system reliability target with minimal effort. We assume that the contribution of a component to system reliability is governed by two factors: the system architecture, and the effort-reliability relationship of the component. This characterization is referred to as âarchitecture-based optimizationâ because it considers the system architecture explicitly in the effort allocation process.

Maintaining large systems is equally hard. Making post-release changes requires not only thorough understanding of the architecture of a software component about to be changed but also its dependencies and interactions with other components in the system. Testing such changes in reasonable time and at a reasonable cost is a difficult problem as infinitely many test cases can be executed for any modification. It is important to obtain a risk assessment of impact of such post-release change fixes. Further, testing of such changes is complicated by the fact that they are applicable to hundreds of millions of users, even the smallest mistakes can translate to a very costly failure and re-work. There has been significant amount of research in the software engineering community on failure prediction, change analysis and test prioritization. Unfortunately, there is little evidence on the use of these techniques in day-to-day software development in industry.

Scientific advancements in individual activities or their integration may bring significant impacts to the practice of software development. Fault localization is the foremost debugging sub-activity. Any effective integration between testing and debugging should address how well testing and fault localization can be worked together productively. How likely does a testing technique provide test suites for effective fault localization? To what extent may such a test suite be prioritized so that the test cases having higher priority can be effectively used in a standalone manner to support fault localization? In this paper, we empirically study these two research questions in the context of test data adequacy, test case prioritization and statistical fault localization. Our preliminary postmortem analysis results on 16 test case prioritization techniques and four statistical fault localizations show that branch-adequate test suites on the Siemens suite are unlikely to support effective fault localization. On the other hand, if such a test suite is effective, around 60% of the test cases can be further prioritized to support effective fault localization, which indicates that the potential savings in terms of effort can be significant.","2332-662X;1550-6002;1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4978-0-7695-4131","10.1109/QSIC.2010.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562990","debugging;testing;continuous integration","Equations;Servers;Measurement;Testing;Debugging;Software;Inspection","continuous improvement;program debugging;program testing;software metrics;software quality;statistical analysis","test adequacy;test case prioritization;statistical fault localization;software debugging;software development;branch adequate test suite;Siemens suite;continuous integration","","4","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the many strategies available to test a software project, the creation of automated test cases that can be enacted after building a release or resolving a defect is increasingly used in the industry. However, certain defects found in the system operation may block major business operations. These critical defects are sometimes resolved directly in the production environment under such a restricted deadline that there is not enough time to run the complete set of automated test cases upon the patched version of the software. Declining to run the test case suite allows a quicker release of the software to production, but also allows other defects to be introduced into the system. This paper presents a heuristic approach to select test cases that might support emergency changes aiming to maximize the coverage and diversity of the testing activity under a strict time constraint and given the priority of the features that were changed.","","978-1-4244-8341","10.1109/SSBSE.2010.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635168","Software Testing;Genetic Algorithm;Time Constraint;Process development;Risk Management","Software;Testing;Optimization;History;Companies;Time factors;Industries","program testing;software engineering","test case selection method;emergency changes;software testing;software development project;test case suite","","1","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software reliability allocation models partially address such issues, but they usually make so many assumptions on the input parameters that their application is difficult in practice. In this paper, we try to reduce this gap, proposing a reliability and testing resources allocation model that is able to provide solutions at various levels of detail, depending upon the information the engineer has about the system. The model aims to quantitatively identify the most critical components of software architecture in order to best assign the testing resources to them.

Since the difficulty of solving this problem is demonstrated to be NP-hard, existing approaches have been designed to generate optimal or near optimal combinatorial test suites in polynomial time. In this paper, we try to apply particle swarm optimization (PSO), a kind of meta-heuristic search technique, to pairwise testing (i.e. a special case of combinatorial testing aiming to cover all the pairwise combinations). To systematically build pairwise test suites, we propose two different PSO based algorithms. One algorithm is based on one-test-at-a-time strategy and the other is based on IPO-like strategy. In these two different algorithms, we use PSO to complete the construction of a single test. To successfully apply PSO to cover more uncovered pairwise combinations in this construction process, we provide a detailed description on how to formulate the search space, define the fitness function and set some heuristic settings. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we implement these algorithms and choose some typical inputs.

However, other important information, such as the ordered sequence of program elements measured by execution frequencies, was ignored by previous studies. It raises a risk to lose detections of difficult-to-find bugs. Therefore, this paper improves the similarity-based test case prioritization using the ordered sequence of program elements measured by execution counts.

The thoroughness of randomized unit testing varies widely according to the settings of certain parameters, such as the relative frequencies with which methods are called. In this paper, we describe Nighthawk, a system which uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to find parameters for randomized unit testing that optimize test coverage. Designing GAs is somewhat of a black art. We therefore use a feature subset selection (FSS) tool to assess the size and content of the representations within the GA.

"Change Sensitivity Based Prioritization for Audit Testing of Webservice Compositions","C. D. Nguyen; A. Marchetto; P. Tonella","NA; NA; NA","2011 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops","","2011","","","357","365","Modern software systems have often the form of Web service compositions. They take advantage of the availability of a variety of external Web services to provide rich and complex functionalities, obtained as the integration of external services. However, Web services change at a fast pace and while syntactic changes are easily detected as interface incompatibilities, other more subtle changes are harder to detect and may give raise to faults. They occur when the interface is compatible with the composition, but the semantics of the service response has changed. This typically involves undocumented or implicit aspects of the service interface. Audit testing of services is the process by which the service integrator makes sure that the service composition continues to work properly with the new versions of the integrated services. Audit testing of services is conducted under strict (sometimes extreme) time and budget constraints. Hence, prioritizing the audit test cases so as to execute the most important ones first becomes of fundamental importance. We propose a test case prioritization method specifically tailored for audit testing of services. Our method is based on the idea that the most important test cases are those that have the highest sensitivity to changes injected into the service responses (mutations). In particular, we consider only changes that do not violate the explicit contract with the service (i.e., the WSDL), but may violate the implicit assumptions made by the service integrator.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954434","Audit Testing;Change Sensitivity;Test Prioritization;Webservice Composition","Testing;Sensitivity;XML;Web services;Monitoring;Semantics;Syntactics","program testing;Web services","change sensitivity based prioritization;audit testing;Web service composition;software system;test case prioritization method;WSDL;service integrator;service interface","","4","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the studies performed to date, however, have evaluated regression testing techniques under the limited context, such as a short-term assessment, which do not fully account for system evolution or industrial circumstances. One important issue associated with a system lifetime view that we have overlooked in past years is the effects of residual defects - defects that persist undetected - across several releases of a system. Depending on an organization's business goals and the type of system being built, residual defects might affect the level of success of the software products. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study to investigate whether regression testing techniques are effective in reducing the occurrence and persistence of residual defects across a system's lifetime, in particular, considering test case prioritization techniques. Our results show that heuristics can be effective in reducing both the occurrence of residual defects and their age. Our results also indicate that residual defects and their age have a strong impact on the cost-benefits of test case prioritization techniques.","2159-4848","978-1-4244-6436-4978-1-4244-6435-7978-0-7695-3990","10.1109/ICST.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477096","Regression testing;test case prioritization;residual defects;empirical study","Testing","program testing;software maintenance;software quality","regression testing;residual defects;software maintenance;software quality;modified software system;short-term assessment;test case prioritization","","2","31","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, there may be insufficient resources to allow for the re-execution of all test cases during regression testing. Testcase prioritization techniques aim to improve the effectiveness of regression testing, by ordering the testcases so that the most beneficial are executed first with higher priority. The objective of test case prioritization is to detect faults as early as possible. An approach for automating the test case prioritization process using genetic algorithm with Multi-Criteria Fitness function is presented. It uses multiple control flow coverage metrics. These metrics measure the degree of coverage of conditions, multiple conditions and statements that the test case covers.

Testers may want to minimize test set size subject to guaranteeing fault detection or they may want to maximize faults detection subject to a test set size. One way to guarantee fault detection is to use heuristics to produce tests that satisfy logic criteria. Some logic criteria have the property that they are satisfied by a test set if detection of certain faults is guaranteed by that test set. An empirical study is conducted to compare test set size and computation time for heuristics and optimization for various faults and criteria. The results show that optimization is a better choice for applications where each test has significant cost, because for a small difference in computation time, optimization reduces test set size. A second empirical study examined the percentage of faults detected in a best, random, and worst case, first for a test set size of one and then again for a test set size of ten. This study showed that if you have a limited number of tests from which to choose, the exact tests you choose have a large impact on fault detection.","","978-1-4244-6774-7978-1-4244-6773-0978-0-7695-4050","10.1109/ICSTW.2010.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463667","Software Logic Testing;Logic Criteria;MUMCUT;Disjunctive Normal Form","Logic testing;Fault detection;Software testing;Boolean functions;Application software;Computer science;Cost function;Terminology","fault tolerant computing;logic programming;optimisation;program testing","optimization application;software logic testing;fault detection;computation time reduction;test set size reduction","","1","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to solve these problems, this paper gives a quantitative approach of software safety test based on FTA and Bayesian networks. In the approach, top-level events of fault trees are identified from system hazards firstly. Then, fault trees are built using FTA and transferred into Bayesian networks. Finally, test cases of software safety test are determined by the Bayesian networks. Besides, the paper also shows an example using the approach, which could guide software engineers to make software safety test more efficient.

In proposed approach a group of similar components are tested together in group form to minimize the testing time. All though testing is involved from very beginning in RUP in order to develop error free component. But still a mechanism to test individual component takes a lot of time. The proposed model saves testing time when accurate developed components are tested in group form.","","978-1-4673-1938-6978-1-4673-1937-9978-1-4673-1936","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297144","Software Development;Test;RUP Discipline;Testing Time;Use Case Diagram","Unified modeling language","program testing;software development management","testing time optimization;RUP;group testing approach;software development life cycle;schedule slippage;rational unified process;construction phase;transition phase;beta testing","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If faults are detected, a fault localization algorithm can be used to reduce the manual inspection cost. However, while using test case prioritization to enhance the rate of fault detection of the test suite (e.g., statement coverage), the diagnostic information gain per test is not optimal, which results in needless inspection cost during diagnosis. We present RAPTOR, a test prioritization algorithm for fault localization, based on reducing the similarity between statement execution patterns as the testing progresses. Unlike previous diagnostic prioritization algorithms, RAPTOR does not require false negative information, and is much less complex. Experimental results from the Software Infrastructure Repository's benchmarks show that RAPTOR is the best technique under realistic conditions, with average cost reductions of 40% with respect to the next best technique, with negligible impact on fault detection capability.","1938-4300","978-1-4577-1639-3978-1-4577-1638","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6100153","","Inspection;Testing;Complexity theory;Software;Subspace constraints;Estimation;Bayesian methods","program testing;software reliability","ambiguity group reduction;regression tests;fault localization algorithm;RAPTOR;test prioritization algorithm;software infrastructure repository;software reliability","","14","46","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper two optimization problem are discussed for optimal allocation of testing resources for the modular software system. These optimization problems are formulated as nonlinear programming problems (NLPP), which are modeled by a software reliability growth model based on a non-homogeneous Poisson process which incorporated Log-logistic testing-effort function.

However, less attention has been paid to the identification of test case pairs, which are eminently suitable for merging. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a novel approach that helps identifying those test case pairs within a given set of systematically generated test cases which, when merged, have potential for high test suite reduction. As a result, test suites reduced by our approach are considerably smaller in size than those, whose pairs are selected randomly.","","978-0-7695-4384","10.1109/MoDeVVa.2010.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772249","model-based testing;test suite reduction","Merging;Fault detection;Unified modeling language;Testing;Iron;Barium;Computer aided software engineering","program testing;software maintenance","model-based generated test suites;test case pair prioritization;software development;software maintenance;systematically generated test cases;high test suite reduction","","3","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing of this increment calls for testing of not only of old newly added functionality but also of existing features so as to make sure that old parts that works perfectly well do not malfunctions after new code is added. Thus a new hybrid technique is proposed in this paper that clusters the test cases and prioritizes the clusters on basis of priorities of requirements represented by the clusters and series of selections and prioritizations at levels of test cases reduces the number of test cases to manageable level and execution of these test cases guarantees the testing of highest priority requirements associated with statements that are often associated with failures or has highest number of parents or sibling's statements dependent on it and is likely to be influenced by changes or failures in this statement.","2325-940X;2325-9418","978-1-4577-1109-1978-1-4577-1110-7978-1-4577-1108","10.1109/INDCON.2011.6139363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6139363","Regression testing;hybrid approach;parallelism;clusters","Testing;Software;Arrays;Visualization;Debugging;Software engineering;Information processing","program testing;program verification;regression analysis;software quality;software reliability","hybrid regression testing technique;multilayered approach;incremental delivery;requirement prioritization;software reliability checking;software quality checking;increment calls;test case execution","","6","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the paper, we introduce an up-to-date search technique, i.e. particle swarm optimization (PSO), to settle this difficulty. After the basic idea of PSO is addressed, the overall framework of PSO-based test data generation is discussed. Here, the inputs of program under test are encoded into particles. During the search process, PSO algorithm is used to generate test inputs with the highest possible coverage rate. Once a set of test inputs is produced, test driver will seed them into program to run and collect coverage information simultaneously. Then, the value of fitness function for branch coverage can be calculated based on such information, which can direct the algorithm optimization in next iteration. In order to validate our method, five real-world programs are used for experimental analysis. The results show that PSO-based method outperforms other algorithms such as GA both in the coverage effect of test data and the convergence speed.","","978-1-4673-1536","10.1109/ICIS.2012.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211162","Test data generation;PSO;branch coverage;fitness function;convergence speed","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Software testing;Particle swarm optimization;Search problems;Vectors","automatic test pattern generation;automatic test software;convergence;iterative methods;particle swarm optimisation;program testing;search problems","automated test data generation;software testing;metaheuristic search techniques;up-to-date search technique;particle swarm optimization;PSO-based test data generation;program testing;PSO algorithm;test driver;fitness function;convergence speed;structural testing","","3","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sets of such inputs have been shown to detect more faults than test sets generated using traditional random and structural testing techniques. Search-based statistical testing employs a metaheuristic search algorithm to automate the otherwise labour-intensive process of deriving the probability distribution. This paper proposes an enhancement to this search algorithm: information obtained during fitness evaluation is used to direct the mutation operator to those parts of the representation where changes may be most beneficial. A principled empirical evaluation demonstrates that this enhancement leads to a significant improvement in algorithm performance, and so increases both the cost-effectiveness and scalability of search-based statistical testing.

In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the product line test space. We introduce a goal-oriented approach for the selection of the most desirable features from the product line. Such an approach allows us to identify the features that are more important and need to be tested more comprehensively from the perspective of the domain stakeholders.

A prioritization technique schedules the test cases for execution so that the test cases with higher priority executed before lower priority. The objective of test case prioritization is to detect fault as early as possible so that the debuggers can begin their work earlier. In this paper we propose a new prioritization technique to prioritize the test cases to perform regression testing for Component Based Software System (CBSS). The components and the state changes for a component based software systems are being represented by UML state chart diagrams which are then converted into Component Interaction Graph (CIG) to describe the interrelation among components. Our prioritization algorithm takes this CIG as input along with the old test cases and generates a prioritized test suit taking into account total number of state changes and total number of database access, both direct and indirect, encountered due to each test case. Our algorithm is found to be very effective in maximizing the objective function and minimizing the cost of system retesting when applied to few JAVA projects.","","978-1-4244-8679-3978-1-4244-8678","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941719","regression testing;software components;state chart diagram;CBSS;CIG","Databases;Testing;Software systems;Fault detection;Unified modeling language;Computational modeling","object-oriented programming;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;Unified Modeling Language","model based prioritization technique;component based software retesting;UML state chart diagram;regression testing;test case prioritization technique;fault detection;component interaction graph;objective function;JAVA","","1","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Using Coverage Information to Guide Test Case Selection in Adaptive Random Testing","Z. Q. Zhou","NA","2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","","2010","","","208","213","Random Testing (RT) is a fundamental software testing technique. Adaptive Random Testing (ART) improves the fault-detection capability of RT by employing the location information of previously executed test cases. Compared with RT, test cases generated in ART are more evenly spread across the input domain. ART has conventionally been applied to programs that have only numerical input types, because the distance between numerical inputs is readily measurable. The vast majority of computer programs, however, involve non-numerical inputs. To apply ART to these programs requires the development of effective new distance measures. Different from those measures that focus on the concrete values of program inputs, in this paper we propose a method to measure the distance using coverage information. The proposed method enables ART to be applied to all kinds of programs regardless of their input types. Empirical studies are further conducted for the branch coverage Manhattan distance measure using the replace and space programs. Experimental results show that, compared with RT, the proposed method significantly reduces the number of test cases required to detect the first failure. This method can be directly applied to prioritize regression test cases, and can also be incorporated into code-based and model-based test case generation tools.","","978-1-4244-8089-0978-0-7695-4105","10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615787","software testing;adaptive random testing;adaptive random sequence;test case prioritization;distance measure","","complete computer programs;program testing;random sequences;software engineering","coverage information;test case selection;adaptive random testing;fault detection capability;location information;test case generation;ART;computer program;nonnumerical input;software testing technique;branch coverage Manhattan distance measure;space program;regression test case;code based test case generation;model based test case generation","","17","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While there may be an aspiration that systems should have models, checkable specifications and/or contract driven development, this sadly remains an aspiration; in many real cases, system behaviour must be checked by a human. This painstaking checking process forms a significant cost, the oracle cost, which previous work on automated test data generation tends to overlook. One simple way to reduce oracle cost consists of reducing the number of tests generated. In this paper we introduce three algorithms which do this without compromising coverage achieved. We present the results of an empirical study of the effectiveness of the three algorithms on five benchmark programs containing non trivial search spaces for branch coverage. The results indicate that it is, indeed, possible to make reductions in the number of test cases produced by search based testing, without loss of coverage.","","978-1-4244-6774-7978-1-4244-6773-0978-0-7695-4050","10.1109/ICSTW.2010.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463645","search based testing;oracle cost;test suite minimization","Cost function;Software testing;Automatic testing;System testing;Humans;Object oriented modeling;Benchmark testing;Software algorithms;Application software;Educational institutions","formal specification;program testing","search based test data generation;oracle cost problem;checkable specifications;contract driven development;nontrivial search spaces;branch coverage","","29","40","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, this work has focused primarily on developing techniques for generating test oracles, in particular techniques based on mutation testing. While effective for test case generation, existing research has not considered the impact of test oracles in the context of regression testing tasks. Of interest here is the problem of test case prioritization, in which a set of test cases are ordered to attempt to detect faults earlier and to improve the effectiveness of testing when the entire set cannot be executed. In this work, we propose a technique for prioritizing test cases that explicitly takes into account the impact of test oracles on the effectiveness of testing. Our technique operates by first capturing the flow of information from variable assignments to test oracles for each test case, and then prioritizing to ``cover'' variables using the shortest paths possible to a test oracle. As a result, we favor test orderings in which many variables impact the test oracle's result early in test execution. Our results demonstrate improvements in rate of fault detection relative to both random and structural coverage based prioritization techniques when applied to faulty versions of three synchronous reactive systems.","1071-9458;1071-9458;2332-6549","978-1-4673-4638-2978-0-7695-4888","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405379","Software testing;software metrics","Testing;Fault detection;Measurement;Instruments;Java;Aircraft;Educational institutions","program testing;regression analysis","Oracle-centric test case prioritization;generating test oracles;mutation testing;regression testing tasks;fault detection;information flow;structural coverage based prioritization techniques;synchronous reactive systems","","6","44","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such challenges descend from the limited testability of external services and encompass traditional regression testing problems, such as test case selection and prioritization, for which existing solutions are nonetheless inadequate.

It is therefore important to test real-time systems for deadline misses. In this paper, we present a strategy for testing real-time applications that aim sat finding test scenarios in which deadline misses become more likely. We identify such test scenarios by searching the possible ways that a set of real-time tasks can be executed according to the scheduling policy of the operating system on which they are running. We formulate this search problem using a constraint optimization model that includes (1) a set of constraints capturing how a given set of tasks with real-time constraints are executed according to a particular scheduling policy, and (2) a cost function that estimates how likely the given tasks are to miss their deadlines.

To date, there has been little research on unique approaches for regression test methodologies for testing in a SaaS environment. In this paper, we present an industrial case study of a regression testing approach to improve test effectiveness and efficiency in SaaS. We model service level use cases from field failures as abstract events and then generate sequences of these for testing to provide a broad coverage of the possible use cases. In subsequent releases of the system we prioritize the tests to improve time to detection of faults in the modified system. We have applied our technique to two releases of a large industrial enterprise level SaaS application and demonstrate that using our approach (1) we could have uncovered escaped faults prior to the system release in both versions of the system; (2) using a priority order we could have improved the efficiency of testing in the first version; and (3) prioritization based on failure history from the first version increases the fault detection rate in the new version, suggesting a correlation between the important sequences in versions that can be leveraged for regression testing.","1063-6773;1063-6773","978-1-4577-0664-6978-1-4577-0663-9978-1-4577-0662","10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080804","Regression Testing;Prioritization;Software as a Service;Cloud Computing","Testing;Software;Companies;Fault detection;Arrays;Maintenance engineering","cloud computing;fault diagnosis;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","regression testing approach;software-as-a-service;SaaS;industrial case study;Web;sequence generation;fault detection;industrial enterprise level;failure history","","7","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we propose to incorporate service selection in executing a test suite and develop a suite of metrics and test case prioritization techniques for the testing of location-aware services. A case study shows that a test case prioritization technique that incorporates service selection can outperform their traditional counterpart - the impact of service selection is noticeable on software engineering techniques in general and on test case prioritization techniques in particular.

However, this is a potentially costly task. To mitigate the costs, the testing effort can be optimized by executing only a selected subset of the test cases that are believed to have a better chance of revealing faults. This paper proposes a novel approach for selecting and ordering a predetermined number of test cases from an existing test suite. Our approach forms an Integer Linear Programming problem using two different coverage-based criteria, and uses constraint relaxation to find many close-to-optimal solution points. These points are then combined to obtain a final solution using a voting mechanism. The selected subset of test cases is then prioritized using a greedy algorithm that maximizes minimum coverage in an iterative manner. The proposed approach has been empirically evaluated and the results show significant improvements over existing approaches for some cases and comparable results for the rest.

Secondly, human intervention or expert judgment is required to opt for level of testing, technique used and quality aspect to be tested. Fuzzy logic has proved its worth in many other domains like communication, bio informatics, embedded applications, industrial and engineering control and network optimization. We propose an expert system that finds a trade off among the quality aspects, technique used and level of testing based on objective function defined by the tester, quite similar to human judgment using fuzzy logic based classification.

Generally the software development process is iterative or incremental in nature, as request for new requirements keep coming from the customers from time to time for inclusion in the next release of the software. Due to the feasibility reasons it is not possible for a company to incorporate all the requirements in the software product. Consequently, it becomes a challenging task for the company to select a subset of the requirements to be included, by keeping the business goals in view. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. As minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem is multi-objective and is also NP-hard in nature. Therefore it cannot be solved efficiently using traditional optimization techniques especially for the large problem instances. QMDEA combines the preeminent features of Differential Evolution and Quantum Computing. The features of QMDEA help in achieving quality Pareto-optimal front solutions with faster convergence. The performance of QMDEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature.

Finally, The reduction approach can reduce the size of test suite dramatically without reducing the coverage rate of test suite and enhance the efficiency of testing.","","978-1-4244-5391-7978-1-4244-5392","10.1109/CISE.2010.5676821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676821","","Bipartite graph;Software;Software testing;Algorithm design and analysis;IEEE Press;Software algorithms","graph theory;optimisation;program testing","graph theory;bipartite graph;test suite optimization;software development testing","","1","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have shown that TDD practices can significantly reduce the number of pre-release defects. However, most TDD research thus far has focused on new development. We investigate the adaptation of TDD-like practices for already implemented code, in particular legacy systems. We call this adaptation of TDD-like practices for already implemented code ``Test-Driven Maintenance'' (TDM). In this paper, we present an approach that assists software development and testing managers, who employ TDM, utilize the limited resources they have for testing legacy systems efficiently. The approach leverages the development history of the project to generate a prioritized list of functions that managers should focus their unit test writing resources on. The list is updated dynamically as the development of the legacy system progresses. To evaluate our approach, we conduct a case study on a large commercial legacy software system. Our findings suggest that heuristics based on the function size, modification frequency and bug fixing frequency should be used to prioritize the unit test writing of legacy systems.","2332-662X;1550-6002;1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4978-0-7695-4131","10.1109/QSIC.2010.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562952","","Computer bugs;Writing;Measurement;History;Time division multiplexing;Maintenance engineering;Data mining","program testing;software development management;software maintenance","test-driven maintenance;test-driven development;software development practice;unit test writing resources;legacy software system;modification frequency;bug fixing frequency","","3","45","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generating test cases for AI-based systems requires balancing breadth of test cases with depth of response quality: most AI-systems may not return a perfect answer. An example of a machine learning translation system is considered, and the approach used for stress testing it is presented, alongside comparisons with a more traditional approach.

Particularly challenging for TDD is the task of selecting a small subset of tests that are most likely to detect a regression fault in a given small and localized code change. We present cost-bounded RTS techniques based on both dynamic program analysis and natural-language analysis. We implemented our techniques in a tool called Test Rank, and evaluated its effectiveness on two open-source projects.

One of the fields where mathematical modeling and optimization have been vastly applied is software reliability, which is the most significant quality metric for commercial software. Such softwares are generally modular in structure. Testing provides a mathematical measure of software reliability and is a process of raising the confidence that the software is free of flaws. However, due to the complexity of software, the testing team may not be able to remove/correct the fault perfectly on observation/detection of a failure and the original fault may remain resulting in a phenomenon known as imperfect debugging, or get replaced by another fault causing error generation. Moreover, fault detection/correction rate may not be same throughout testing; it may change at any time moment called as change point. Also, testing cannot be done indefinitely due to the availability of limited testing resources. In this paper we formulate an optimization problem to allocate the resources among different modules such that the total fault removal is maximized while incorporating the effect of both types of imperfect debugging and change point. The relative importance of each module is obtained using Analytical Hierarchy Process. We have also considered the problem of determining minimum requirement of the testing resources so that a desired proportion of faults are removed from each module. The non linear optimization problems are solved using genetic algorithm. Numerical example has been discussed to illustrate the solution of the formulated optimal resource allocation problems.","","978-1-4244-8343-3978-1-4244-8344","10.1109/ICRESH.2010.5779607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779607","Software Reliability Growth model;Change Point;Genetic Algorithm","Resource management","decision making;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;genetic algorithms;nonlinear programming;program debugging;program testing;resource allocation;software metrics;software performance evaluation;software quality;software reliability","optimal testing resource allocation;modular software;imperfect debugging;genetic algorithm;optimal decision making;mathematical modeling;software reliability;quality metric;commercial software;mathematical measure;software complexity;testing team;failure observation;failure detection;fault causing error generation;fault correction rate;change point;fault removal;analytical hierarchy process;testing resources;nonlinear optimization problems;optimal resource allocation problems","","1","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"ÂµTIL: Mutation-based Statistical Test Inputs Generation for Automatic Fault Localization","M. Delahaye; L. C. Briand; A. Gotlieb; M. Petit","NA; NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Software Security and Reliability","","2012","","","197","206","Automatic Fault Localization (AFL) is a process to locate faults automatically in software programs. Essentially, an AFL method takes as input a set of test cases including failed test cases, and ranks the statements of a program from the most likely to the least likely to contain a fault. As a result, the efficiency of an AFL method depends on the ""quality"" of the test cases used to rank statements. More specifically, in order to improve the accuracy of their ranking within test budget constraints, we have to ensure that program statements are executed by a reasonably large number of test cases which provide a coverage as uniform as possible of the input domain. This paper proposes Î¼TIL, a new statistical test inputs generation method dedicated to AFL, based on constraint solving and mutation testing. Using mutants where the locations of injected faults are known, Î¼TIL is able to significantly reduce the length of an AFL test suite while retaining its accuracy (i.e., the code size to examine before spotting the fault). In order to address the motivations stated above, the statistical generator objectives are two-fold: 1) each feasible path of the program is activated with the same probability, 2) the sub domain associated to each feasible path is uniformly covered. Using several widely used ranking techniques (i.e., Tarantula, Jaccard, Ochiai), we show on a small but realistic program that a proof-of-concept implementation of Î¼TIL can generate test sets with significantly better fault localization accuracy than both random testing and adaptive random testing. We also show on the same program that using mutation testing enables a 75% length reduction of the AFL test suite without decrease in accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2067-2978-0-7695-4742","10.1109/SERE.2012.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258309","Random testing;Automatic Fault Localization;Mutation analysis","Accuracy;Generators;Java;Software;Software testing;Debugging","program testing;software fault tolerance;statistical testing","Î¼TIL;mutation-based statistical test inputs generation;automatic fault localization;software programs;test budget constraints;program statements;constraint solving;mutation testing;statistical generator;ranking techniques","","","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They rely on the analysis of the impact of changes in source code artifacts, identifying corresponding parts of software to retest. While effective in minimizing the amount of testing required to validate code changes, they do not leverage on specification-level design and requirements concerns that motivated these changes. Model-based testing approaches support a top-down (or black box) testing approach, where design and requirements models are used in support of test generation. They augment code-based approaches with the ability to test from a higher-level design and requirements perspective. In this paper, we present a model-based regression testing and prioritization approach that efficiently selects test cases for regression testing based on different concerns. It relies on traceability links between models, test cases and code artifacts, together with user-defined properties associated to model elements. In particular we describe how to support concern-based regression testing and prioritization using TDE/UML, an extensible model-based testing environment.","","978-1-4244-8089-0978-0-7695-4105","10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615818","Model-driven testing;test development;regression testing;test prioritization","","program testing;regression analysis","supporting concern based regression testing;model driven environment;source code artifacts;specification level design;model based testing approaches;code based approaches;user defined properties;UML","","6","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each stage in software development has a corresponding testing activity. Testing activity consumes about 50% of software development resources, so any technique aiming at reducing software-testing costs is likely to reduce software development costs. Proposed by NASA in 1994, the Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) criterion is a testing strategy required, among other practices, by the RTCA DO-178B. MC/DC is a white box testing criterion aiming at proving evidence that all clauses involved in a predicate can influence the predicate value in the required way. It subsumes other well-known coverage criteria such as statement and decision coverage. Our work involves a thorough study of the MC/DC criterion and our approach is organized in the following way. We automate the generation of number of test cases required to satisfy the MC/DC criterion.

Code coverage, however, does not consider frequency, furthermore, comparison between JD and CMD has not yet been made. This research fills the gap by first investigating the fault-detection capabilities of using frequency information for AR test case prioritization, and then comparing JD and CMD. Experimental results show that ""coverage"" was more useful than ""frequency"" although the latter can sometimes complement the former, and that CMD was superior to JD.

In previous work, we proposed novel test case selection techniques that minimize the similarities among selected test cases and outperforms other selection alternatives. In this paper, our goal is to gain insights into why and under which conditions similarity-based selection techniques, and in particular our approach, can be expected to work. We investigate the properties of test suites with respect to similarities among fault revealing test cases. We thus identify the ideal situation in which a similarity-based selection works best, which is useful for devising more effective similarity functions. We also address the specific situation in which a test suite contains outliers, that is a small group of very different test cases, and show that it decreases the effectiveness of similarity-based selection.

A GUI contains graphical objects with certain distinct values which can be used to determine the state of the GUI at any time. Software developing organizations always desire to test the software thoroughly to get maximum confidence about its quality. But this requires gigantic effort to test a GUI application due to the complexity involved in such applications. This problem has led to the automation of GUI testing and different techniques have been proposed for automated GUI Testing. Event-flow graph is a fresh technique being used in the field of automated GUI testing. Just as control-flow graph, another GUI model that represents all possible execution paths in a program, event-flow model, in the same way, represents all promising progressions of events that can be executed on the GUI. Another challenging question in software testing is, âHow much testing is enough?â As development proceeds, there are fewer measures available that can be used to provide guidance on the quality of an automatic test suite. Genetic algorithm searches for the best possible test parameter combinations that are according to some predefined test criterion. Usually this test criterion corresponds to a âcoverage functionâ that measures how much of the automatically generated optimization parameters satisfies the given test criterion.

Models of soft- and hardware components at runtime, expressing current and alternative system configurations, are exploited to improve service utility as well as to decrease energy consumption. In recent work we showed how quality contracts - expressing dependencies between software and hardware components - can be used for energy auto-tuning. Notably, the declared provisions and requirements of individual components depend on software containers (i.e., the servers, components are deployed on) and thus, cannot be declared completely at design time. In this paper we present a semi-automated contract creation process that combines manual created contract templates with benchmarking and mathematical approximations for nonfunctional properties depending on the components' runtime behavior as well as their service's input parameters. We identify individual process activities and show how the process can be applied to approximate the nonfunctional behavior of software components providing simple sorting functionality.","","978-1-4673-1832-7978-1-4673-1833","10.1109/GREENS.2012.6224264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224264","Quality Contracts;Benchmarking;Energy Self-Optimization","Contracts;Software;Benchmark testing;Time factors;Hardware;Approximation methods;Runtime","contracts;energy consumption;optimisation;software engineering;sorting","quality contracts;energy auto-tuning software;future software systems;self-optimization;w.r.t. energy efficiency;service utility;energy consumption;software containers;semi-automated contract creation process;nonfunctional behavior;sorting functionality","","6","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such testing, the system under test is abstractly modeled as a finite state machine having a finite set of states and a labeled transition relation between the states. A pushdown system, additionally, has an unbounded stack. Test inputs are then generated by enumerating a set of sequences of transitions labels from the model. There has been a lot of research that focussed on generation of test input sequences satisfying various coverage criteria. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating a set of test input sequences that satisfy certain coverage criteria-cover all transition labels or cover all length-n transition label sequences at least once-while minimizing the sum of the length of the sequences in the set. We show that these optimal test input generation problems can be reduced to integer linear programming (ILP) problems. We also prove that our optimal test input generation problems are NP-Complete.

To achieve full confidence, many projects have to re-run all the test cases for entire program, which makes it a time consuming and expensive activity. In this paper, a code based regression testing approach is proposed to generate selected test suites for unit testing. The framework contains five phases: program change detection phase, logical verification phase, branch pruning phase, test case prioritization phase and test suite generation phase. These five phases can achieve detection of program's modification, coding standard, test case pruning, test case prioritizing and inputs generation for regression test cases respectively. A prototype based on this framework is implemented using logical tree-structured analysis, and the preliminary experiment shows that proposed approach can provide efficient regression test suites.","","978-1-4244-6462-3978-1-4244-6461-6978-0-7695-3999","10.1109/ICCSA.2010.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476640","regression test;automated test generation;white-box test;software verification","Regression tree analysis;Logic testing;Software testing;Automatic testing;Phase detection;Life testing;Software maintenance;Prototypes;Computer architecture;Tree data structures","program diagnostics;regression analysis","regression test generation approach;code based regression testing;program change detection phase;logical verification phase;branch pruning phase;test case prioritization phase;test suite generation phase;program modification detection;coding standard;test case pruning;logical tree-structured analysis","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing from an (E)FSM generally involves executing various transition paths, until a given coverage criterion (e.g. cover all transitions) is met. As traditional test generation methods from FSM only consider the control aspects, they can produce many infeasible paths when applied to EFSMs, due to conflicts in guard conditions along a path. In order to avoid the infeasible path generation, we propose an approach that obtains feasible paths dynamically, instead of performing static reachability analysis as usual for FSM-based methods. Previous works have treated EFSM test case generation as a mono-objective optimization problem. Our approach takes two objectives into account that are the coverage criterion and the solution length. In this way, it is not necessary to establish in advance the test case size as earlier approaches. MOST constructs a Pareto set approximation, i.e., a group of optimal solutions, which allows the test team to select the solutions that represent a good trade-off between both objectives. The paper shows empirical studies to illustrate the benefits of the approach and comparing the results with the ones obtained in a related work.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954406","model-based testing;feasible path;search-based testing;EFSM","Testing;Analytical models;Unified modeling language;Adaptation models;Neodymium;Optimization;Asynchronous transfer mode","approximation theory;evolutionary computation;finite state machines;Pareto optimisation;program testing","multiobjective search-based testing;extended finite state machines;multiobjective evolutionary approach;test case generation;test transition path;test coverage criterion;reachability analysis;Pareto set approximation;monoobjective optimization problem","","7","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a known fact that companies will pay less to fix problems that are found very early in any software development cycle.

The proposed online quality analysis system ensures that software requirements among others are complete, consistent, correct, modifiable, ranked, traceable, unambiguous, and understandable. The system interacts with the developer through a series of questions and answers session, and requests the developer to go through a checklist that corresponds to the list of desirable characteristics for SRS.

Recent computer architecture trends towards chip multiprocessing and multithreading have raised new challenges in the test process. In this paper, we present a novel self-test optimization strategy for multithreaded, multicore microprocessor architectures and apply it to both manufacturing testing (execution from on-chip cache memory) and post-silicon validation (execution from main memory) setups. The proposed self-test program execution optimization aims to: (a) take maximum advantage of the available execution parallelism provided by multiple threads and multiple cores, (b) preserve the high fault coverage that single-thread execution provides for the processor components, and (c) enhance the fault coverage of the thread-specific control logic of the multithreaded multiprocessor. The proposed multithreaded (MT) SBST methodology generates an efficient multithreaded version of the test program and schedules the resulting test threads into the hardware threads of the processor to reduce the overall test execution time and on the same time to increase the overall fault coverage. We demonstrate our methodology in the OpenSPARC T1 processor model which integrates eight CPU cores, each one supporting four hardware threads. MT-SBST methodology and scheduling algorithm significantly speeds up self-test time at both the core level (3.6 times) and the processor level (6.0 times) against single-threaded execution, while at the same time it improves the overall fault coverage. Compared with straightforward multithreaded execution, it reduces the self-test time at both the core level and the processor level by 33% and 20%, respectively. Overall, MT-SBST reaches more than 91% stuck-at fault coverage for the functional units and 88% for the entire chip multiprocessor, a total of more than 1.5M logic gates.","2378-2250;1089-3539;1089-3539","978-1-4244-7207-9978-1-4244-7206-2978-1-4244-7205","10.1109/TEST.2010.5699277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699277","","Instruction sets;Built-in self-test;Parallel processing;Manufacturing;Multicore processing;Logic gates","built-in self test;electronic engineering computing;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading","MT-SBST;self-test optimization;multithreaded multicore architecture;instruction-based testing;software-based self-testing;scalable functional testing;multithreaded microprocessor;multicore microprocessor;OpenSPARC T1 processor","","13","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the use of an evolutionary approach, called genetic algorithms, for test-suite reduction. The proposed model builds the initial population based on test history, calculates the fitness value using coverage and run time of test case, and then selectively breeds the successive generations using genetic operations and allows only the fit tests to the reduced suite.

Through the coverage relationship between test requirements and test cases, test suite reduction problem can be converted into the standard optimization problem. Quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) is an intelligent algorithm based on quantum computation . In QEA, chromosomes are encoded with quantum bits as the basic information bits, and individual variation evolution is realized by quantum mutation based on quantum probability gates. So in QEA, the convergence speed and ability to search global best results are superior to the traditional evolutionary algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose a novel test suite reduction method using quantum evolutionary.

Windisch","NA; NA","2010 Third International Conference on Software Testing, Verification, and Validation Workshops","","2010","","","202","211","This paper presents a technique to consider constraints on input signals of continuous systems when applying search-based testing. The signal constraints are described using a logic based on Signal Temporal Logic. We developed a distance-oriented evaluation technique for these constraints that provides an exact rating of the amount of constraint violation, thus allowing a ranking of the generated solutions in terms of constraint violation. An adaptive penalty function is then used to incorporate the evaluation results into the optimization. Finally, the overall method is shown to be capable of considering signal constraints appropriately when experimentally applied to search-based black-box testing of a MATLAB SIMULINK model of an automatic transmission controller.","","978-1-4244-6774-7978-1-4244-6773-0978-0-7695-4050","10.1109/ICSTW.2010.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463647","Search-Based Testing;Continuous Systems;Constraint Handling;Signal Constraints;Temporal Logic","System testing;Continuous time systems;Automatic testing;Software testing;Reproducibility of results;Evolutionary computation;Application software;Performance evaluation;Computer industry;Computer bugs","constraint handling;particle swarm optimisation;program testing","signal constraints consideration;continuous systems search based testing;signal constraints;temporal logic signal;distance oriented evaluation technique;constraint violation;black box testing;MATLAB SIMULINK model;automatic transmission controller","","3","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, especially for multi-core processors, the notion of dependability encompasses not only high quality on-line tests with minimum performance overhead but also methods for preventing the generation of excessive power and heat that exacerbate silicon aging mechanisms and can cause long term reliability problems. In this paper, we initially extend the capabilities of a multiprocessor simulator in order to evaluate the overhead in the execution of the useful application load in terms of both performance and energy consumption. We utilize the derived power evaluation framework to assess the overhead of SBST implemented as a test thread in a multiprocessor environment. A range of typical processor configurations is considered. The application load consists of some representative SPEC benchmarks, and various scenarios for the execution of the test thread are studied (sporadic or continuous execution). Finally, we apply in a multiprocessor context an energy optimization methodology that was originally proposed to increase battery life for battery-powered devices. The methodology reduces significantly the energy and performance overhead without affecting the test coverage of the SBST routines.","1942-9398;1942-9401","978-1-4244-7723-4978-1-4244-7724-1978-1-4244-7722","10.1109/IOLTS.2010.5560233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560233","software-based self-testing;hard faults;multiprocessors;on-line test;low energy optimization","Program processors;Benchmark testing;Delay;Circuit faults;Energy consumption;Hardware","automatic test pattern generation;automatic test software;fault diagnosis;microprocessor chips;multi-threading","online hard fault detection;multiprocessor application;energy constraint;software-based self-test;processor testing;non safety-critical system;multicore processors;processor dependability;performance overhead;silicon aging;reliability problem;energy consumption;power evaluation framework;multiprocessor environment;processor configuration;sporadic execution;continuous execution;energy optimization","","","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security experts need to know code locations on which to focus their testing and inspection efforts. Since vulnerabilities are rare occurrences, locating vulnerable code locations can be a challenging task. We investigated whether software metrics obtained from source code and development history are discriminative and predictive of vulnerable code locations. If so, security experts can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts. The metrics we investigated fall into three categories: complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics. We performed two empirical case studies on large, widely used open-source projects: the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel. The results indicate that 24 of the 28 metrics collected are discriminative of vulnerabilities for both projects. The models using all three types of metrics together predicted over 80 percent of the known vulnerable files with less than 25 percent false positives for both projects. Compared to a random selection of files for inspection and testing, these models would have reduced the number of files and the number of lines of code to inspect or test by over 71 and 28 percent, respectively, for both projects.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2010.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560680","Fault prediction;software metrics;software security;vulnerability prediction.","Fault diagnosis;Software security;Complexity theory;Predictive models;Charge coupled devices","Linux;online front-ends;program testing;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software metrics","code churn;software vulnerabilities;developer activity metrics;security inspection;software metrics;source code;vulnerable code locations;open-source projects;Mozilla Firefox Web browser;Red Hat enterprise Linux kernel","","109","43","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To a certain extent, their widespread adoption is due to the software engineering benefits provided by these managed execution environments, for example, garbage collection (GC) and cross-platform portability. Although HLL VMs are widely used, most research has concentrated on high-end optimizations such as dynamic compilation and advanced GC techniques. Few efforts have focused on introducing features that automate or facilitate certain software engineering activities, including software testing. This paper suggests that HLL VMs provide a reasonable basis for building an integrated software testing environment. As a proof-of-concept, we have augmented a Java virtual machine (JVM) to support weak mutation analysis. Our mutation-aware HLL VM capitalizes on the relationship between a program execution and the underlying managed execution environment, thereby speeding up the execution of the program under test and its associated mutants. To provide some evidence of the performance of our implementation, we conducted an experiment to compare the efficiency of our VM-based implementation with a strong mutation testing tool (muJava). Experimental results show that the VM-based implementation achieves speedups of as much as 89% in some cases.","2159-4848","978-0-7695-4670-4978-1-4577-1906","10.1109/ICST.2012.158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200170","Mutation Analysis;Java Virtual Machine;Software Testing;Maxine VM;mu Java","Arrays;Context;Testing;Instruments;Runtime;Java;Virtual machining","high level languages;program testing;virtual machines","weak mutation testing;high-level language virtual machines;high-level programming languages;software engineering;garbage collection;cross-platform portability;high-end optimizations;dynamic compilation;advanced GC techniques;integrated software testing environment;Java virtual machine;weak mutation analysis;mutation-aware HLL VM;program execution;managed execution environment;program under test","","2","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent techniques for model-based testing do not sufficiently take into consideration the information derived from the safety analyses like Failure Mode and Effect Analysis and Fault Tree Analyses (FTA).

The most popular method to get timed software TLMs is to annotate timing information at the basic-block level granularity back into application source code, called source code instrumentation (SCI). The existing SCI approaches realize the back-annotation of timing information based on mapping between source code and binary code. However, optimizing compilation has a large impact on the code mapping and will lower the accuracy of the generated source-level TLMs. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to tackle this problem. We propose to use mapping between source-level and binary-level control flows as the basis for timing annotation instead of code mapping.

"Using Non-redundant Mutation Operators and Test Suite Prioritization to Achieve Efficient and Scalable Mutation Analysis","R. Just; G. M. Kapfhammer; F. Schweiggert","NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","","2012","","","11","20","Mutation analysis is a powerful and unbiased technique to assess the quality of input values and test oracles. However, its application domain is still limited due to the fact that it is a time consuming and computationally expensive method, especially when used with large and complex software systems. Addressing these challenges, this paper makes several contributions to significantly improve the efficiency of mutation analysis. First, it investigates the decrease in generated mutants by applying a reduced, yet sufficient, set of mutants for replacing conditional (COR) and relational (ROR) operators. The analysis of ten real-world applications, with 400,000 lines of code and more than 550,000 generated mutants in total, reveals a reduction in the number of mutants created of up to 37% and more than 25% on average. Yet, since the isolated use of non-redundant mutation operators does not ensure that mutation analysis is efficient and scalable, this paper also presents and experimentally evaluates an optimized workflow that exploits the redundancies and runtime differences of test cases to reorder and split the corresponding test suite. Using the same ten open-source applications, an empirical study convincingly demonstrates that the combination of non-redundant operators and prioritization leveraging information about the runtime and mutation coverage of tests reduces the total cost of mutation analysis further by as much as 65%.","1071-9458;1071-9458;2332-6549","978-1-4673-4638-2978-0-7695-4888","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405400","","Runtime;Redundancy;Testing;Educational institutions;Connectors;Computer science;Software systems","program diagnostics;program testing","nonredundant operators;open-source applications;real-world application analysis;complex software systems;large software systems;computationally expensive method;test oracles;scalable mutation analysis;test suite prioritization;nonredundant mutation operators","","17","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing complete interactions of constituent systems and checking the compliance with service level constraints as and when they are plugged into the SoS requires significant effort. Therefore, there is a need for testing methodologies to validate such complex systems in a comprehensive and optimal way.

Constraints model interdependence among the conditions in the expressions. Only tests that satisfy the constraints. i.e. valid tests, are really useful and can be applied to test the expression. We present three ways to deal with such constraints: (1) ignoring them during test generation and removing invalid tests later, (2) including them in the expression as conjoint and again removing invalid tests later, and (3) considering them during the test generation process in order to generate only valid tests from the start. We introduce a general framework in which the three policies are implemented and compared over a set of Boolean expressions commonly used as benchmarks. Although the third policy requires a constraints solving technique for actual test generation, it presents several benefits: it generates smaller test suites and it may require less time for tests generation. Moreover, ignoring the constraints during test generation can reduce the fault detection capability of the tests.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.94","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954429","logic testing;Boolean specification testing;test generation","Fault detection;Optimization;Monitoring;Computational modeling;Logic testing;Terminology","program testing;programming languages","Boolean expression testing;testing constraint;test generation process;test fault detection capability","","1","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

He refered to the papers by Tractenberg and Downs as providing a foundation for these models. I propose using Musa's basic model in combination with an approach Duane and Codier used to estimate failure intensity (aka instantaneous failure rate) for software. Musa noted in his last book that the Basic law is optimistic in estimating residual errors and that the logarithmic law is pessimistic because it implies infinite errors. There is currently a problem in deciding which law to use for software, Basic or Logarithmic, other than which has a higher correlation coefficient. I recommend that Musa's basic law be used but that the line be drawn using a method that reflects the cumulative nature of the statistics. This approach is based on both Downs' paper and that presented by E. O. Codier at the 1968 Annual Symposium on Reliability which described how to draw the line for Duane growth plots. Codier argued that when reliability growth data is plotted: (1) âThe latter points, having more information content, must be given more weight than earlier pointsâ (2) âThe normal curve fitting procedure of drawing the line through the `center of gravity' of all the points should not be used.â and (3) âUnless the data is exceptionally noisy, the best procedure is to start the line on the last data point and seek the region of highest density of points to the left of it.â With regard to Musa basic plots, the region of highest density would be to the right of the last point, not to the left of it. It should be noted here that the IEEE Recommended Practice on Software Reliability for the application of Duane states that âLeast squares estimates for a and b of the straight line on log-log paper can be derived using recommended practice linear regression estimatesâ. But Codier's recommendations (above) have been shown to result in a more accurate measure of MTBF for hardware. This would be just as true for the application of Duane growth plo ts for software as for hardware. This paper shows even greater improvements when Codier's methods are applied to Musa's Basic model for Software. The early paper by Thomas Downs referred to the curved lines that are fitted to operational profile data as âconvexâ, not logarithmic, because there is no firm basis for calling the distribution logarithmic. There are examples in physics of exponential decay, as in the half life of a radioactive element, that follow a logarithmic curve, but no such mechanism exists to justify fitting a log function to software test data. The recommended method avoids defining the optimistic and pessimistic extremes of the curves as linear, logarithmic or any other specific shape. It simply draws a line that follows the changing slope of the points naturally as originally proposed by Codier. This paper develops a methodology for calculating failure intensity from the slope of the resulting line and from the cumulative failure rate at the final data point. It avoids the optimism of the Basic law and the pessimism of the Logarithmic law as well as the decision of which to use.","0149-144X;0149-144X","978-1-4244-8856-8978-1-4244-8857-5978-1-4244-8855","10.1109/RAMS.2011.5754434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5754434","Duane;Musa Basic Model;Musa-Okumoto Logarithmic Law;reliability growth;software reliability","Software reliability;Testing;Gravity;Reliability engineering;Software systems","curve fitting;least squares approximations;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;software process improvement","software reliability estimation;growth test data;Musa basic law;Musa-Okumoto logarithmic law;failure intensity estimation;residual error estimation;cumulative statistics;curve fitting;least squares estimation;linear regression estimate;MTBF;Duane growth plots;distribution logarithmic;Codier method","","2","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper also proposes a new measure of test cases - the Test Case Rate of utilization (TCR), which can comprehensively assess the generated test suite.","","978-89-94364-20-9978-1-4673-0876","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528673","metamorphic testing;ECCEM criterion;measurement criterion;test case rate of utilization","","equivalence classes;program testing","optimized method;metamorphic testing;oracle problem;software testing;ECCEM criterion;equivalence-class coverage for every metamorphic relation;test case rate of utilization;TCR","","","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although data structures have been used for decades few studies have examined the effectiveness of different testing strategies applied to complex data structures. In this study, four different testing approaches were used to test a priority queue. The results showed that a state transition testing approach (13 faults discovered) was clearly superior with regards to the number of faults found than the alternatives of a manual testing approach (3 faults discovered), a unit testing approach (4 faults discovered), and a classical test harness approach (6 faults discovered). Because the state transition testing approach used was in essence a modified form of random input testing, the results of this study suggest that the notion that random input testing is typically less effective than other forms of testing may be an overly broad generalization.","","978-1-61284-427-5978-0-7695-4367","10.1109/ITNG.2011.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945247","Priority queue;software testing;state transition;test harness;unit testing","Testing;Arrays;Indexes;Manuals;Queueing analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","data structures;formal verification;program testing;queueing theory","random access priority queue;functional verification;data structure;state transition testing approach;manual testing approach;unit testing approach;classical test harness approach","","","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But, for both algorithms, there was a little limitation to target path in path testing for being prone to local optimal solution. Some researchers have combined the genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithm to generate the test data path, in which the result was better. At the same time, they found hybrid ant colony algorithm was still subject to the limitation of global search ability of ant colony algorithm. The Ant colony system algorithm is improved based on the ant colony algorithm. It is proved that it is more suitable for global search. In the present study, we propose to combine the ant colony system algorithm and genetic algorithm (ACSGA) to generate path-oriented software testing data.

This paper proposes a method that enables the designer to optimally select hardware and software components of a digital protective relay to gain the highest possible overall reliability with a restricted budget. This design can be viewed as a reliability and redundancy allocation problem for which a new easy-to-implement algorithm is proposed. In contrast to the existing literature that views the problem of routine test interval optimization solely from a reliability viewpoint, this paper proposes an optimization procedure for determining optimal test intervals. The optimization objective function consists of three terms: cost of routine tests, losses due to relay unresponsiveness, and losses due to relay maloperation. The value of the objective function is calculated based on a new, simple, and comprehensive Markov model. Illustrative numerical examples clarify the application of the proposed methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in achieving an optimum for both cases.","0885-8977;1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2170859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6078449","Design;optimization;protection systems;reliability;routine tests","Software reliability;Power system reliability;Relays;Optimization;Hardware;Software","maintenance engineering;Markov processes;power system economics;power system reliability;redundancy;relay protection;testing","routine test optimization;modern protection system design;protection system reliability;economic constraints;optimal modern protective relay;optimal routine test;relay failure;digital protective relay;redundancy allocation problem;optimization procedure;relay maloperation;Markov model","","10","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It helps programmers raise the awareness about subtle correctness issues in the early stage. However, static defect detection tools face the high false positive rate problem. Therefore, programmers have to spend a considerable amount of time on screening out real bugs from a large number of reported warnings, which is time-consuming and inefficient. To alleviate the above problem during the report inspection process, we present EFindBugs to employ an effective two-stage error ranking strategy that suppresses the false positives and ranks the true error reports on top, so that real bugs existing in the programs could be more easily found and fixed by the programmers. In the first stage, EFindBugs initializes the ranking by assigning predefined defect likelihood for each bug pattern and sorting the error reports by the defect likelihood in descending order. In the second stage, EFindbugs optimizes the initial ranking self-adaptively through the feedback from users. This optimization process is executed automatically and based on the correlations among error reports with the same bug pattern. Our experiment on three widely-used Java projects (AspectJ, Tomcat, and Axis) shows that our ranking strategy outperforms the original ranking in Find Bugs in terms of precision, recall and F1-score.","2159-4848","978-1-61284-174-8978-0-7695-4342","10.1109/ICST.2011.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770619","Static Analysis Tool;Error Ranking;FindBugs","Detectors;Computer bugs;Java;Correlation;Optimization;Sorting;Software","inspection;Java;program debugging;program diagnostics;software tools","EFindBugs;error ranking;static analysis tool;static defect detection tool;report inspection process;error sorting;optimization process;Java project;AspectJ;Tomcat;Axis","","7","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The considered model for the machine is such that outputs for transitions leading to non-terminal states will be buffered and contents of buffers will only be made observable when terminal states are entered. The X-machine testing method has been extended in this work to handle such an extension of X-machines (EFSM).Priorities of operations determine the order in which guards of transitions are evaluated. This makes it possible to reduce the size of a test suite. For instance, if testing has shown that a transition with a specific guard g has been implemented from some state, then no lower-priority transition with a guard implied by g may ever be executed from that state. It is hence not necessary to test for the presence of such a lower-priority transition.","2159-4848","978-1-61284-174-8978-0-7695-4342","10.1109/ICST.2011.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770602","Test Generation;Finite-State Machines;Extended Finite-State Machines;FSM;EFSM;X-machines","Testing;Schedules;Automata;Context;Unified modeling language;Data models","finite state machines;program testing","test generation;X-machines;nonterminal states;operation priority;extended finite-state machine","","","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exhaustive testing of the embedded systems in the critical regions is important as the embedded systems must be basically fail safe systems. The Critical regions of the input space of the embedded systems can be pre-identified and supplied as seeds.

We investigate ways of assessing both classification models and ranking models, and the extent to which metrics appropriate for one type of model are also appropriate for the other.

However, granting a system autonomy over its operation removes the ability of the developer to be completely sure of the system's behaviour under all operating contexts. This combination of environmental and behavioural uncertainty makes the achievement of assurance through testing very problematic. This paper focuses on a class of system, called an m-DAS, that uses run-time models to drive run-time adaptations in changing environmental conditions. We propose a testing approach which is itself model-driven, using model analysis to significantly reduce the set of test cases needed to test for emergent behaviour.

In this paper, we propose a modified version of the ABC to improve its performance, in terms of converging to individual optimal point and to compensate the limited amount of search moves of original ABC. In modified version called Dichotomous ABC (DABC), the idea is to move dichotomously in both directions to generate a new trial point. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed on five standard benchmark problems and also we explored the applicability of the proposed algorithm to estimate the parameters of software reliability growth models (SRGM).

Tool support is essential for timed testing, as timed test cases cannot be executed manually with the required precision. In case studies, we found that the existing timed testing tools do not fulfill all requirements needed for real-world-timed testing: they lack both features and responsiveness. Therefore, we have started the implementation of a timed testing tool called TripleT. TripleT is based on the notion of timed ioco as conformance relation, and uses as basis algorithms already present in TorX. However, we have improved in the responsiveness and execution time of our test cases - two major points when it comes to timeliness in timed testing. This has been achieved by using look-ahead and parallelizing the test case execution of TripleT.

These FW panels are one of the critical components in the ITER tokamak with a maximum surface heat flux of 5 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, a qualification test needs to be performed with the goal to qualify the joining technologies required for the ITER FW. Various mock-ups were fabricated to develop the manufacturing procedure of FW components. For the nondestructive examination of the fabricated mock-ups, an ultrasonic test (UT) was performed with optimized probes. The UT was performed by using a three-axis digital ultrasonic C-scan system and software. The system comprised an ultrasonic pulser and receiver, model Panametrics 5800PR; a personal computer having an internal analog/digital converter board and four-axis motion control board; and a three-axis scanning tank. Two types of transducers were used for this experiment. One was Panametrics V312-SU, having a center frequency of 10 MHz (nominal) and a piezoelectric element diameter of 0.25 in with a flat protective layer for the Be/Cu. The other was Panametrics V309-SU with a center frequency of 5 MHz and an element diameter of 0.5 in for the Cu/SS interface. Winspect software controlled all aspects of data acquisition, motion control, data archiving, and image display. Based on the acceptance criteria, the average amplitude of the interface signals, which have about 50% of the reference echo amplitude, was recorded and analyzed on each beryllium tile. An image-analysis software analyzed the statistics of amplitude distribution and calculated the unacceptable area. Each mock-up that passed these UTs was concluded to qualify the joining technologies required for an ITER FW by using a high-heat flux test facility. As a result of these qualification tests based on the acceptance criteria of an ITER FW, the fabrication technologies will be utilized to develop the FW of plasma-facing components.","0093-3813;1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2012.2206614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253269","ITER;mock-up;nondestructive examination;qualification test;semiprototype;ultrasonic test (UT)","Acoustics;Beryllium;Heating;Fabrication;Software;Cooling","analogue-digital conversion;armour;beryllium;copper;data acquisition;heat sinks;image processing;information retrieval systems;joining processes;motion control;piezoelectric transducers;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma-wall interactions;protective coatings;stainless steel;Tokamak devices;ultrasonic materials testing","nondestructive testing;ITER first wall;beryllium armour;heat sink;stainless steel back plate;FW panels;ITER tokamak;surface heat flux;joining technology;manufacturing procedure;ultrasonic test;three-axis digital ultrasonic C-scan system;ultrasonic pulser;ultrasonic receiver;Panametrics 5800PR;internal analog-digital converter;four-axis motion control board;three-axis scanning tank;transducers;piezoelectric element;Winspect software;data acquisition;data archiving;image display;acceptance criteria;interface signals;reference echo amplitude;image-analysis software;amplitude distribution;high-heat flux test facility;plasma-facing components;frequency 10 MHz","","3","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The motivation behind this effort is to achieve zero known post release defects of the software delivered to end-user. Besides serving as the indicator of optimizing testing process, predicting functional defects at the start of testing allows testing team to put comprehensive test coverage, find as many defects as possible and determine when to stop testing so that all known defects are contained within testing phase. Design for Six Sigma (DfSS) is chosen as the methodology as it emphasizes on customers' requirement and systematic techniques to build the model. Historical data becomes the crucial elements in this study. Metrics related to potential predictors and their relationships for the model are identified, which focuses on metrics in phases prior to testing phase. Repeatability and capability of testers' consistency in finding defects are analyzed. Type of data required are also identified and collected. The metrics of selected predictors which incorporate testing and development metrics are measured against total functional defects using multiple regression analysis. The best and most significant mathematical model generated by the regression analysis is selected as the proposed prediction model for functional defects in system testing phase. Validation of the model is then conducted to prove the goodness for implementation.

Therefore, determination of which software testing phases to focus improvements work on, has considerable industrial interest. This paper evaluates the use of five different techniques, namely particle swarm optimization based artificial neural networks (PSO-ANN), artificial immune recognition systems (AIRS), gene expression programming (GEP), genetic programming (GP) and multiple regression (MR), for predicting the number of faults slipping through unit, function, integration and system testing phases. The objective is to quantify improvement potential in different testing phases by striving towards finding the right faults in the right phase. We have conducted an empirical study of two large projects from a telecommunication company developing mobile platforms and wireless semiconductors. The results are compared using simple residuals, goodness of fit and absolute relative error measures. They indicate that the four search-based techniques (PSO-ANN, AIRS, GEP, GP) perform better than multiple regression for predicting the fault-slip-through for each of the four testing phases. At the unit and function testing phases, AIRS and PSO-ANN performed better while GP performed better at integration and system testing phases. The study concludes that a variety of search-based techniques are applicable for predicting the improvement potential in different testing phases with GP showing more consistent performance across two of the four test phases.","","978-1-4244-8341","10.1109/SSBSE.2010.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635180","","Artificial neural networks;Companies;Programming;Software testing;Software quality;Predictive models","artificial immune systems;fault tolerant computing;genetic algorithms;neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;program testing;regression analysis","search-based prediction;fault-slip-through;software project;software testing process;particle swarm optimization;artificial neural network;PSO-ANN;artificial immune recognition system;AIRS;gene expression programming;GEP;genetic programming;GP;multiple regression;MR","","10","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nature of wireless communication does not allow for a-priori determination of network topology, network-defining metrics such as neighbor density and routing span may drastically differ for various deployments. Therefore, it is a difficult problem to foresee and consider the large number of possible topologies that a system may run on during protocol stack development. We propose to use an automated approach for searching topologies for which a protocol stack exhibits particularly poor quantitative performance. We formulate stress testing of protocol stacks on specific topologies as a multi-objective optimization problem and use an evolutionary algorithm for finding a set of small topologies that particularly stress the protocol stack of a wireless network. For searching the topology space, we present novel problem-specific variation operators and show their improvements on search performance in case studies. We showcase our results on stress testing using two protocol stacks for wireless sensor networks.","2159-4848","978-0-7695-4670-4978-1-4577-1906","10.1109/ICST.2012.178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200190","Testing;Software Testing;Wireless Networks;Wireless Sensor Networks","Topology;Network topology;Protocols;Quality of service;Testing;Stress;Wireless sensor networks","evolutionary computation;protocols;search problems;telecommunication equipment testing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor networks","search-based stress testing;wireless network protocol stack;network topology;channel contention;neighbor density metric;routing span metric;protocol stack development;multiobjective optimization problem;evolutionary algorithm;topology space;problem-specific variation operator;search performance;wireless sensor network","","3","40","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scale of redundancy employed affects reliability favorably, while increasing the cost of software design and development.

However, these models easily become intractable if the system under consideration is too complex or large. Moreover, existing DG-based algorithms for test generation and optimization are rare and rather in an initial stage. Finally, DG models fail to represent languages beyond type-3 (regular). This paper proposes a grammar-based mutation testing framework, together with effective mutation operators, coverage concepts and algorithms for test sequence generation. The objective is to establish a formal framework for model-based mutation testing which enables complementary or alternative use of regular grammars, depending on the preferences of the test engineer.

Our study has been conducted on two large software systems: Microsoft VISTA and ECLIPSE. Our results show that components that have outgoing dependencies to components with higher object-oriented complexity tend to have fewer field failures for VISTA, but the opposite relation holds for ECLIPSE. Likewise, other notable observations have been made through our study that (a) confirm that certain characteristics of components increase the risk of their dependencies to fail and (b) some of the characteristics are project specific while some were also found to be common. We expect that such results can be leveraged for use to provide new directions for research in defect prediction, test prioritization and related research fields that utilize code dependencies in their empirical analysis.

However, exhaustive testing is practically impossible due to time and resource limitations. To address this issue, there is a need for a sampling strategy that can select a subset of inputs as test data from an inherently large search space. Recent findings demonstrate that t-way interaction testing strategies based on artificial intelligence (i.e. where t indicates interaction strength) have been successful to obtain a near optimal solution resulting into smaller test set to be considered. Motivated by such findings, we have developed a new test generation strategy, called Particle Swarm Test Generator (PSTG).

Using a common software interface (HyFlex), the same algorithms (high-level strategies or hyper-heuristics) can be readily run on all of them. The study is intended as a proof of concept of the proposed interface and domain modules, as a benchmark for testing the generalisation abilities of heuristic search algorithms. Several algorithms and variants from the literature were implemented and tested. From them, the implementation of iterated local search produced the best overall performance. Interestingly, this is one of the most conceptually simple competing algorithms, its advantage as a robust algorithm is probably due to two factors: (i) the simple yet powerful exploration/exploitation balance achieved by systematically combining a perturbation followed by local search; and (ii) its parameter-less nature. We believe that the challenge is still open for the design of robust algorithms that can learn and adapt to the available low-level heuristics, and thus select and apply them accordingly.","1089-778X;1941-0026","978-1-4244-6911-6978-1-4244-6909-3978-1-4244-6910","10.1109/CEC.2010.5586064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5586064","","Personnel;Heuristic algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Algorithm design and analysis;Software algorithms;Software;Optimization","bin packing;combinatorial mathematics;flow shop scheduling;heuristic programming;optimisation;personnel;search problems","general-purpose search algorithm;hyper-heuristic research;combinatorial optimisation;bin packing;permutation flow shop;personnel scheduling;HyFlex software interface;interface module;domain module;heuristic search algorithm;iterated local search;exploration-exploitation balance;low-level heuristics","","13","42","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Prioritizing Mutation Operators Based on Importance Sampling","M. Sridharan; A. S. Namin","NA; NA","2010 IEEE 21st International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","","2010","","","378","387","Mutation testing is a fault-based testing technique for measuring the adequacy of a test suite. Test suites are assigned scores based on their ability to expose synthetic faults (i.e., mutants) generated by a range of well-defined mathematical operators. The test suites can then be augmented to expose the mutants that remain undetected and are not semantically equivalent to the original code. However, the mutation score can be increased superfluously by mutants that are easy to expose. In addition, it is infeasible to examine all the mutants generated by a large set of mutation operators. Existing approaches have therefore focused on determining the sufficient set of mutation operators and the set of equivalent mutants. Instead, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach that prioritizes operators whose mutants are likely to remain unexposed by the existing test suites. Probabilistic sampling methods are adapted to iteratively examine a subset of the available mutants and direct focus towards the more informative operators. Experimental results show that the proposed approach identifies more than 90% of the important operators by examining ? 20% of the available mutants, and causes a 6% increase in the importance measure of the selected mutants.","1071-9458;1071-9458;2332-6549","978-1-4244-9056-1978-0-7695-4255","10.1109/ISSRE.2010.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635074","Mutation Testing;Testing Effectiveness;Importance Sampling;Bayesian Reasoning","Testing;Monte Carlo methods;Entropy;Probability distribution;Equations;Probabilistic logic;Stochastic processes","Bayes methods;importance sampling;program testing;software fault tolerance","mutation operators;importance sampling;mutation testing;fault-based testing technique;Bayesian approach;probabilistic sampling method","","11","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both problems negatively affect model based testing. In fact, over-approximation results in infeasible test cases, i.e., test cases that cannot be activated by any input data. Under-approximation results in missing test cases, i.e., system behaviours that are not represented in the model are also never tested. In this paper we balance over- and under-approximation of inferred models by resorting to multi-objective optimization achieved by means of two search-based algorithms: A multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the NSGA-II. We report the results on two open-source web applications and compare the multi-objective optimization to the state-of-the-art KLFA tool. We show that it is possible to identify regions in the Pareto front that contain models which violate fewer application constraints and have a higher bug detection ratio. The Pareto fronts generated by the multi-objective GA contain a region where models violate on average 2% of an application's constraints, compared to 2.8% for NSGA-II and 28.3% for the KLFA models. Similarly, it is possible to identify a region on the Pareto front where the multi-objective GA inferred models have an average bug detection ratio of 110 : 3 and the NSGA-II inferred models have an average bug detection ratio of 101 : 6. This compares to a bug detection ratio of 310928 : 13 for the KLFA tool.","2159-4848","978-0-7695-4670-4978-1-4577-1906","10.1109/ICST.2012.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200093","Model inference;Model-based testing;Search-based software engineering","Computational modeling;Genetic algorithms;Inference algorithms;Optimization;Approximation methods;Measurement;Testing","formal specification;genetic algorithms;Internet;program testing;public domain software","optimal balance;model over approximation;model under approximation;models Inferred from Execution Logs;execution traces;over-approximation;under-approximation;model based testing;system behaviours;multiobjective optimization;search-based algorithms;multiobjective genetic algorithm;NSGA-II;open-source Web applications;KLFA tool;bug detection ratio;Pareto fronts;multiobjective GA inferred models","","3","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A technology that promises further increase of transistor density (in addition with heterogeneous integration, better performance and less power dissipation at a smaller footprint) is the three-dimensional stacked ICs (3D-SICs). Several stacking approaches are under development to manufacture such 3D-SICs. Wafer-to-Wafer (W2W) stacking seems the most favorable approach when high manufacturing throughput, thinned wafers and small die handling is required. However, efficient and optimal test approaches to satisfy the required quality are still subject to research. Each manufactured 3D-SIC undergoes a test and therefore optimizing test cost will have a large overall impact. This paper discusses test cost optimization for W2W 3D-SICs. It first introduces a framework covering different test flows for 3D W2W ICs. Test flows that include pre-bond tests can benefit from wafer matching; in wafer matching a software algorithm is used to increase the compound yield by stacking wafers with similar fault distributions. Subsequently, the paper proposes a cost model to evaluate and estimate the impact of test flows on the overall 3D-SIC cost. Our simulation results show that test flows with pre-bond testing in general significantly reduce the overall cost. These test flows benefit mostly from the yield increase due to wafer matching.","","978-1-4673-1928-7978-1-4673-1926-3978-1-4673-1927","10.1109/DTIS.2012.6232983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232983","W2W;3D W2W test flows;pre-bond testing;wafer matching","Stacking;Packaging;Manufacturing;Testing;Compounds;Integrated circuit modeling;Semiconductor device modeling","integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit yield;stacking;three-dimensional integrated circuits;transistors","test cost optimization;wafer-to-wafer stacking;three-dimensional integrated circuits;3D IC;transistors;wafer matching;software algorithm;compound yield;pre-bond testing","","","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose a method of supporting test oracle creation. This method automatically selects the oracle data - the set of variables monitored during testing - for expected value test oracles. This approach is based on the use of mutation analysis to rank variables in terms of fault-finding effectiveness, thus automating the selection of the oracle data. Experiments over four industrial examples demonstrate that our method may be a cost-effective approach for producing small, effective oracle data, with fault finding improvements over current industrial best practice of up to 145.8% observed.","1558-1225;0270-5257;0270-5257","978-1-4673-1067-3978-1-4673-1066-6978-1-4673-1065","10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227132","testing;test oracles;oracle data;oracle selection;verification","Testing;Training;Monitoring;Aerospace electronics;Greedy algorithms;Software systems","fault diagnosis;program testing","automated oracle creation support;fault propagation;love mutation testing;testing process;oracle data selection;mutation analysis;rank variables;fault-finding effectiveness","","19","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the reasons is that, CPSs are often applied to mission-critical processes. Also, the automation CPSs bring in managing physical processes, and the detail of information available to them for carrying out their tasks, make securing them a prime importance. Securing CPSs is a difficult task as systems are interconnected. In order to achieve a continuous secured CPS environment, there is the need for an integrated methodology to analyze, specify and prioritize security requirements and also to develop policies to meet them. First, CPS assets are represented using high-order object models. Second, swim lane diagrams are extended to include malactivities and prevention or mitigation options to decompose use cases. We analyze security threats pertaining to the hardware components, software components and the hardware-software interaction. Security requirements are then specified, and an analytical prioritization approach, based on relative priority analysis is employed to prioritize them. Finally, security policies are then developed to meet the requirements. To demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate its application, the proposed methodology is applied in a structured approach to a test bed - Ayushman, a Pervasive Health Monitoring System (PHMS).","","978-1-4577-0781-0978-0-7695-4454","10.1109/SSIRI-C.2011.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004511","cyber-physical systems (CPS);CPS security requirements;high order object oriented modeling technique;CPS security requirements prioritization;hardware-software interaction","Security;Object oriented modeling;Analytical models;Unified modeling language;Monitoring;Software;Object recognition","formal specification;health care;medical computing;object-oriented programming;security of data;systems analysis;ubiquitous computing","security requirements analysis;security requirement specification;security requirement prioritization;policy development;cyber-physical system;mission-critical process;swim lane diagram;malactivity;prevention options;mitigation options;security threat analysis;hardware components;software components;hardware-software interaction;relative priority analysis;Ayushman;Pervasive Health Monitoring System","","5","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While such approaches have enhanced our ability to find bugs in programs, running large numbers of tests remains a time consuming and expensive task, especially for tests that execute operations on external resources, such as a file system or a network. This paper presents a novel technique for optimizing execution of suites of tests, where several tests in a suite may contain common initial execution -- a property often exhibited by systematically generated suites, e.g., those for bounded exhaustive testing. Our insight is that we can cluster execution of such tests by defining abstract-level undo operations, which allow a common execution segment to be performed once, and its result to be shared across the tests, which then perform the rest of their operations. We present our framework for clustered execution of test suites, and evaluate it using three case-studies, which show our technique enables significant performance speed-up over traditional test execution.","2332-6549;1071-9458;1071-9458","978-1-4577-2060-4978-0-7695-4568","10.1109/ISSRE.2011.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132959","test clustering;check-pointing;unit test suites;undo operations","Databases;Testing;Semantics;Receivers;Instruments;Clustering algorithms;Context","checkpointing;optimisation;pattern clustering;program debugging;program testing;program verification","test input generation;suite execution optimization;systematically generated suites;bounded exhaustive testing;execution clustering;abstract level undo operation;execution segment","","2","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past decade, SDO techniques have been established as a promising tool for aviation analysis. Given a parameter-dependent simulation model, SDO techniques can automatically determine the optimal parameters that yield the desired simulation behavior. SDO techniques have been applied to aviation problems such as flight trajectory optimization, air traffic flow design and safety analysis of auto-land systems. The algorithmic solution of an SDO problem requires communication between simulation code (e.g., the numerical solution of the equations of motion) and optimization code (e.g., the Newton method). Typically, multiple simulations must be performed to form the numerical derivative of the cost function we seek to minimize or maximize, which must then be passed to some optimization software. This paper introduces the ""Time-Stepping for Optimization"" software framework or TSOpt to aid solution of SDO problems. TSOpt orchestrates communication and data exchange between the optimization code and the simulation code. TSOpt also offers support for implementation variants of the adjoint state method, a numerically efficient way to form derivatives for SDO problems. Further, TSOpt is equipped with tests that help ensure the correct numerical solution of SDO problems. Besides a concrete C++ software package, TSOpt framework offers a software paradigm that can be used to solve SDO problems on any platform, and in any language. I demonstrate this claim by solving a exploring the effect of low-fidelity wind data for a trajectory-based optimization problem in MATLAB.","2155-7209;2155-7195;2155-7195","978-1-61284-798-6978-1-61284-797-9978-1-61284-796","10.1109/DASC.2011.6096134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096134","","Mathematical model;Numerical models;Optimization;Unified modeling language;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Differential equations","aerospace computing;aircraft landing guidance;digital simulation;electronic data interchange;optimising compilers;parameter estimation;software architecture","modular software framework;simulation-driven optimization technique;SDO problem;aviation analysis;parameter-dependent simulation model;optimal parameter determination;autoland systems;simulation code;optimization code;time-stepping for optimization software framework;MATLAB;trajectory-based optimization problem;low-fidelity wind data;data exchange;TSOpt","","","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature.

A typical activity to maximise testing productivity is to allocate test cases according to the testers' profile. However, optimising the allocation of manual test cases is not a trivial task: in big companies, test managers are responsible for allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems. Each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles, which results in six possible allocation systems. METHOD: We run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites, each one with at least 50 test cases, from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager's allocation in terms of precision, recall and unassignment (percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate). RESULTS: In our experiment, the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics. For unassignment, three of our six allocation systems achieved zero (best value) for the unassignment rate. CONCLUSION: The results of our experiment suggest that, in similar environments, test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task. In the real industrial setting in which our work was developed, managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation. Our algorithms can help them do it faster and better.","1949-3770;1938-6451;1949-3789","978-1-4503-1056-7978-1-4503-1056-7978-1-4503-1056","10.1145/2372251.2372289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475418","Recommender systems;Test allocation;Manual testing","Resource management;Recommender systems;Testing;Measurement;Context;Approximation algorithms;Manuals","program testing;recommender systems;statistical analysis","recommender systems;manual testing;software testing;testing productivity maximization;test case allocation;assignment algorithms;tester profiles;statistical analysis;precision metrics;recall metrics;unassignment rate","","5","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software cost estimation is the process of prognosticating the amount of effort required to build a software project.

PSO is employed to generate parameters of the COCOMO model for each cluster of data values. The clusters and effort parameters are then trained to a Neural Network by using Back propagation technique, for classification of data. Here we have tested the model on the COCOMO 81 dataset and also compared the obtained values with standard COCOMO model. By making use of the experience from Neural Networks and the efficient tuning of parameters by PSO operating on clusters, the proposed model is able to generate better results and it can be applied efficiently to larger data sets.","","978-1-4244-9477-4978-1-4244-9478-1978-1-4244-9475-0978-1-4244-9476","10.1109/RAICS.2011.6069439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6069439","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);K-Means algorithm;Software Cost estimation;COnstructive COst MOdel(COCOMO);Back propagation algorithm;CPN:Clustering-PSO-Neural Networks","Software;Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Training;Software algorithms;Mathematical model;Data models","backpropagation;cost-benefit analysis;neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;Petri nets;software cost estimation","CPN hybrid model;software cost estimation;software project requirement;software development phase;cost-benefit analysis;particle swarm optimization;K-means clustering algorithm;neural network;backpropagation technique;data classification;COCOMO model;colored Petri nets","","","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new approach that applies GP to improve existing software by optimizing its non-functional properties such as execution time, memory usage, or power consumption. In general, satisfying non-functional requirements is a difficult task and often achieved in part by optimizing compilers. However, modern compilers are in general not always able to produce semantically equivalent alternatives that optimize non-functional properties, even if such alternatives are known to exist: this is usually due to the limited local nature of such optimizations. In this paper, we discuss how best to combine and extend the existing evolutionary methods of GP, multiobjective optimization, and coevolution in order to improve existing software. Given as input the implementation of a function, we attempt to evolve a semantically equivalent version, in this case optimized to reduce execution time subject to a given probability distribution of inputs. We demonstrate that our framework is able to produce non-obvious optimizations that compilers are not yet able to generate on eight example functions. We employ a coevolved population of test cases to encourage the preservation of the function's semantics. We exploit the original program both through seeding of the population in order to focus the search, and as an oracle for testing purposes.

The goal of this research is to improve the prioritization of security fortification efforts by investigating the ability of SQL hotspots to be used as the basis for a heuristic for prediction of all vulnerability types.

Using statistical analysis, we show that the more SQL hotspots a file contains per line of code, the higher the probability that file will contain any type of vulnerability.","2159-4848","978-1-61284-174-8978-0-7695-4342","10.1109/ICST.2011.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770611","sql;hotspots;sql injection;prioritization;empirical;wordpress;wikkawiki","Security;Predictive models;Measurement;Mathematical model;Complexity theory;Software;Databases","Internet;probability;search engines;security of data;software metrics;SQL;statistical analysis;Web sites","SQL hotspots;prioritization heuristic;Web application vulnerability;development organizations;core business logic;database interaction code;database code;SQL injection;security fortification efforts;open source PHP Web applications;Word Press;blogging application;WikkaWiki;wiki management engine;statistical analysis;probability","","11","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Industry often performs linearity test for such high-precision data converters with significantly reduced numbers of code measurements during production test. Given a specified allowed number of code measurements, the problem is to determine the requisite code points that result in the highest failure coverage. In this paper, a methodology and tools for analyzing the ""goodness"" of a particular choice of test code points versus another is described. A least squares based polynomial fitting approach using measurements made at selected test code points is used to characterize the transfer function of the ADC for INL (Integral Nonlinearity) error. In addition, the characteristics of devices that may escape from the proposed approach (test escapes) are revealed for the specified test via an optimization based search technique. Software simulations are performed to study and validate the proposed methodology.","","978-0-7695-4479-3978-1-4577-1144","10.1109/IMS3TW.2011.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132741","","Polynomials;Histograms;Voltage measurement;Testing;Fitting;Operational amplifiers;Optimization","integrated circuit testing;least squares approximations;optimisation;polynomials;sigma-delta modulation;transfer functions","sigma-delta based incremental ADC;optimal linearity testing;restricted code measurements;analog-to-digital converters;histogram based testing;high-precision data converters;production test;failure coverage;test code points;least squares based polynomial fitting;transfer function;integral nonlinearity error;optimization;search technique","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CTS selects a small subset of tests to fulfill the original testing task by clustering execution profiles. In observation-based testing, CTS saves human efforts for result inspection by reducing the number of tests and finding failures as many as possible. This paper proposes a novel strategy, namely WAS (Weighted Attribute based Strategy), to improve CTS. WAS is inspired by the idea of fault localization, which ranks the program entities to find possible faulty entities. The ranking of entity is considered as a weight of attribute in WAS. And then it helps build up a more suitable distance space for CTS. As a result, a more accurate clustering is obtained to improve CTS. We conducted an experiment on three open-source programs: flex, grep and gzip. The experimental results show that WAS can outperform all existing CTS techniques in observation-based testing.","","978-1-4673-2067-2978-0-7695-4742","10.1109/SERE.2012.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258303","Iteratively clustering;Attribute weight;Fault localization;Test selection;Jaccard","Conferences;Software;Security;Software reliability","program testing;public domain software;regression analysis","cluster test selection;CTS;observation-based testing;regression testing;clustering execution profiles;inspection;failure finding;weighted attribute based strategy;fault localization;open-source programs;flex;grep;gzip","","2","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These first wall panels are one of the critical components in the ITER tokamak with a maximum surface heat flux of 5 MW/m2. So, a qualification test needs to be performed with the goal to qualify the joining technologies required for the ITER first wall. Various mockups were fabricated to develop the manufacturing procedure of first wall components. For the non-destructive examination (NDE) of the fabricated mockups, an ultrasonic test (UT) was performed with optimized probes. The UT test was performed by using a three-axis digital ultrasonic C-scan system and software. The system is comprised of an ultrasonic pulser/receiver, model Panametrics 5800PR, a personal computer having an internal analog/digital converter board and four axis motion control board, and a three-axis scanning tank. Two type transducers were used for this experiment. One was Panametrics V312-SU, having a center frequency of 10 MHz (nominal), a piezoelectric element diameter of 0.25 inch with a flat protective layer for the Be/Cu. The other was Panametrics V309-SU with a center frequency of 5 MHz and an element diameter of 0.5 inch for the Cu/SS interface. Winspect software controlled all aspects of data acquisition, motion control, data archiving, and image display. Based on the acceptance criteria, average amplitude of the interface signals, which have about 50% of the reference echo amplitude, was recorded and analyzed on each beryllium tile. Image analysis software analyzed the statistics of amplitude distribution and calculated the unacceptable area. Each mockup that passed these UT tests was concluded to qualify the joining technologies required for an ITER first wall by using high heat flux test facility. As a result of these qualification tests based on the acceptance criteria of an ITER first wall, the fabrication technologies will be utilized to develop the first wall of plasma facing components.","2155-9953;1078-8891;1078-8891;1078-8891","978-1-4577-0668-4978-1-4577-0669-1978-1-4673-0103-9978-1-4577-0667","10.1109/SOFE.2011.6052288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6052288","ITER;semi-prototype;mockup;NDE;Ultrasonic test;Qualification test","Image resolution;Acoustics;Copper;Heating;Prototypes;Receivers;Oscilloscopes","analogue-digital conversion;beryllium;copper;data acquisition;fusion reactor design;heat sinks;joining processes;motion control;nondestructive testing;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;plasma-wall interactions;stainless steel;Tokamak devices;transducers","nondestructive method;ITER first wall development;heat sink;stainless steel back plate;ITER tokamak critical component;surface heat flux;joining technology;ultrasonic test;mockup test;three-axis digital ultrasonic C-scan system;ultrasonic pulser;ultrasonic receiver;Panametrics 5800PR model;analog-digital converter board;four axis motion control board;three-axis scanning tank;Panametrics V312-SU;piezoelectric element diameter;Winspect software;data acquisition;data archiving;image display analysis;image analysis software;amplitude distribution statistics;high heat flux test facility;plasma facing components;size 0.25 inch;frequency 10 MHz;frequency 5 MHz;size 0.5 inch","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, online and in-field testing is necessary to guarantee correctness of operation. At the same time, online testing of processors integrated in WSN nodes has the requirement of minimum energy consumption, because these devices operate on battery, cannot be connected to any external power supply, and the battery duration determines the lifetime of the system. Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) has emerged as an effective strategy for online testing of processors integrated in nonsafety critical applications. However, the notion of dependability includes not only reliability but also availability. Thus, in order to encase both aspects we present a methodology for the optimization of SBST routines from the energy perspective. The refined methodology presented in this paper is able to be effectively applied in the case that the SBST routines are not initially available and need to be downloaded to the WSN nodes, as well as the case that the SBST routines are available in a flash memory. The methodology is extended to maximize the energy gains for WSN architectures offering clock gating or Dynamic Frequency Scaling features. Simulation results show that energy savings at processor level are up to 36.5 percent, which depending on the characteristics of the WSN system, can translate in several weeks of increased lifetime, especially if the routines need to be downloaded to the WSN node.","1545-5971;1941-0018;2160-9209","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714702","Dependability;low energy;online testing;processor test;test generation;Wireless Sensor Network nodes.","Wireless sensor networks;Program processors;Encoding;Optimization;Built-in self-test;Testing;Online services","embedded systems;energy consumption;microprocessor chips;program testing;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","low energy online self test;embedded processors;dependable WSN nodes;wireless sensor network;environmental hazards;energy consumption;external power supply;battery duration;software based self test;SBST;flash memory;clock gating;dynamic frequency scaling features","","10","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This reliability allocation also helps to allocate test resources such as cost and schedule effectively. In order to achieve these advantages, it needs to identify the optimal software reliability allocation for multiple objectives, which maximize software reliability and minimize cost and schedule. However, it is difficult to identify an optimal software reliability allocation because reliability, cost, and schedule conflict with each other. Currently, there are several software reliability allocation techniques, but schedule planning and effective resource use are unavailable because they do not support multi-objective optimization. This paper proposes an effective software reliability allocation technique that supports multi-objective optimization. The proposed approach uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for the multi-objective optimization. This approach assists schedule planning as well as effective resources allocation. A case study is presented to show the strength of the proposed approach.

Pre-deployment protocol conformance testing is essential to ensure reliable communications for WSNs. Unfortunately, existing solutions with simulators cannot test the exact hardware and implementation environment as real sensors, whereas testbeds are expensive and limited to small scale networks and topologies. In this paper, we present RealProct, a novel and reliable framework for testing protocol implementations against their specifications in WSNs. RealProct utilizes real sensors for protocol conformance testing to ensure that the results are close to the real deployment. Using different techniques from those in simulations and real deployments, RealProct virtualizes a large network with any topology and generate non-deterministic events using only a small number of sensors to provide flexibility and to reduce the cost. The framework is carefully designed to support efficient testing in resource-limited sensors. Moreover, test execution and verdict are optimized to minimize the number of runs, while guaranteeing satisfactory false posi tive and false negative rates. We implement RealProct and test it with the IIP TCP/IP protocol stack and a routing protocol developed for WSNs in Contiki-2.4.

However, the supply of kidneys is far short of the fast-growing demand. Kidney paired donation (KPD) programs provide an innovative approach for increasing the number of available kidneys. In a KPD program, willing but incompatible donor-candidate pairs may exchange donor organs to achieve mutual benefit. Recently, research on exchanges initiated by altruistic donors (ADs) has attracted great attention because the resultant organ exchange mechanisms offer advantages that increase the effectiveness of KPD programs. Currently, most KPD programs focus on rule-based strategies of prioritizing kidney donation. In this paper, we consider and compare two graph-based organ allocation algorithms to optimize an outcome-based strategy defined by the overall expected utility of kidney exchanges in a KPD program with both incompatible pairs and ADs. We develop an interactive software-based decision support system to model, monitor, and visualize a conceptual KPD program, which aims to assist clinicians in the evaluation of different kidney allocation strategies. Using this system, we demonstrate empirically that an outcome-based strategy for kidney exchanges leads to improvement in both the quantity and quality of kidney transplantation through comprehensive simulation experiments.","0018-9294;1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2195663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188515","Kidney exchanges;optimal matches;software","Kidney;Resource management;Computational modeling;Optimal matching;Blood;Uncertainty;Graphical user interfaces","decision support systems;diseases;graph theory;interactive systems;kidney;knowledge based systems;medical computing;optimisation;patient monitoring;patient treatment","graph-based optimization algorithm;kidney exchanges;kidney transplantation;patient treatment;end-stage renal disease;kidney paired donation programs;altruistic donors;organ exchange mechanisms;rule-based strategy;graph-based organ allocation algorithms;outcome-based strategy;interactive software-based decision support system;conceptual KPD program","Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Histocompatibility Testing;Humans;Kidney Transplantation;Living Donors;Medical Informatics Applications;Software;User-Computer Interface","11","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such system-level indicators are intended to enable meaningful comparisons among systems or to serve as triggers for a deeper analysis.Common methods for aggregation range from simple mathematical operations (e.g. addition and central tendency) to more complex methodologies such as distribution fitting, wealth inequality metrics (e.g. Gini coefficient and Theil Index) and custom formulae.However, these methodologies provide little guidance for interpreting the aggregated results or to trace back to individual measurements.To resolve such limitations, a two-stage rating approach has been proposed where (i) measurement values are compared to thresholds to summarize them into risk profiles, and (ii) risk profiles are mapped to ratings.In this paper, we extend our approach for deriving metric thresholds from benchmark data into a methodology for benchmark-based calibration of two-stage aggregation of metrics into ratings.We explain the core algorithm of the methodology and we demonstrate its application to various metrics of the SIG quality model, using a benchmark of 100 software systems.We present an evaluation of the sensitivity of the algorithm to the underlying data.","","978-1-4577-1930","10.1109/IWSM-MENSURA.2011.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113040","Metrics aggregation;Benchmark;Software quality;Complexity","Benchmark testing;Indexes;Partitioning algorithms;Calibration;Software;Optimization","software metrics;software quality","benchmark-based aggregation;software metrics;coding tasks;high-level quality indicators;software systems;system-level indicators;mathematical operations;distribution fitting;wealth inequality metrics;custom formulae;two-stage rating approach;risk profiles;SIG quality model","","17","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to be effective, all t combinations of input parameters must be tested. While many t-way strategies can be used to generate the t-way test data (e.g. IPOG, AETG, GT-Way, Jenny, TVG and MIPOG), most do not ensure that all t combinations of input parameters can be practically tested. Addressing this issue, this paper highlights a new type of constraints that might prevent some t-way parameter interactions from being tested (and hence compromising the effectiveness of t-way testing), termed input-input relationship constraints. Apart from ensuring all t combinations are properly tested, input-input relationship constraints can further optimize the generated test data since all impossible combinations are completely ignored. In addition, this paper also introduces a new strategy that supports input-input relationship constraints and demonstrates the correctness of the strategy as well as the effectiveness of test data with input-input relationship.","","978-1-4577-1417-7978-1-4577-1418-4978-1-4577-1416","10.1109/ISIEA.2011.6108767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6108767","interaction testing;t-way testing;input-input relationship;combinatorial testing","Software testing;Educational institutions;Software;Generators;Hardware","automatic testing","input-input relationship constraints;t-way testing;generated test data","","1","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they are difficult to write manually, and automatic mining techniques suffer from 90-99 percent false positive rates. To address this problem, we propose to augment a temporal-property miner by incorporating code quality metrics. We measure code quality by extracting additional information from the software engineering process and using information from code that is more likely to be correct, as well as code that is less likely to be correct. When used as a preprocessing step for an existing specification miner, our technique identifies which input is most indicative of correct program behavior, which allows off-the-shelf techniques to learn the same number of specifications using only 45 percent of their original input. As a novel inference technique, our approach has few false positives in practice (63 percent when balancing precision and recall, 3 percent when focused on precision), while still finding useful specifications (e.g., those that find many bugs) on over 1.5 million lines of code.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2011.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680914","Specification mining;machine learning;software engineering;code metrics;program understanding.","Software measurement;Refactoring;Data mining;Maintenance engineering;Cloning;Optimization","data mining;formal specification;program debugging;program testing;software quality","specification mining;formal specifications;program testing;optimization;refactoring;documentation;debugging;repair;automatic mining techniques;temporal-property miner;code quality metrics;software engineering process","","11","61","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, many fault localization techniques require non-trivial number of test cases with oracles, which can determine whether a program behaves correctly for every test input. Test oracle creation is expensive because it can take much manual labeling effort. Given a number of test cases to be executed, it is challenging to minimize the number of test cases requiring manual labeling and in the meantime achieve good fault localization accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel test case selection strategy based on Diversity Maximization Speedup (DMS). DMS orders a set of unlabeled test cases in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of a fault localization technique. Developers are only expected to label a much smaller number of test cases along this ordering to achieve good fault localization results. Our experiments with more than 250 bugs from the Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository show (1) that DMS can help existing fault localization techniques to achieve comparable accuracy with on average 67% fewer labeled test cases than previously best test case prioritization techniques, and (2) that given a labeling budget (i.e., a fixed number of labeled test cases), DMS can help existing fault localization techniques reduce their debugging cost (in terms of the amount of code needed to be inspected to locate faults). We conduct hypothesis test and show that the saving of the debugging cost we achieve for the real C programs are statistically significant.","","978-1-4503-1204-2978-1-4503-1204","10.1145/2351676.2351682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494903","Fault Localization;Test Case Prioritization","","C language;program debugging;program testing","C programs;test case prioritization techniques;software-artifact infrastructure repository;DMS;test case selection strategy;manual labeling;test oracle creation;fault localization techniques;debugging effort reduction;diversity maximization speedup","","7","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a web community is able to let emerge a collective intelligence with a higher performance in solving problems than the single members of the community. Based on the successes of collective intelligence systems like Wikipedia, the web encyclopedia, the question arises, whether such a collaborative web community could also be capable of function optimization. This paper introduces an optimization algorithm called Community Optimization (CO), which optimizes a function by simulating a collaborative web community, which edits or improves an article-base, or, more general, a knowledge-base. In order to realize this, CO implements a behavioral model derived from the human behavior that can be observed within certain types of web communities (e.g., Wikipedia or open source communities). The introduced CO method is applied to four well-known benchmark problems. CO significantly outperformed the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization as well as two Differential Evolution approaches in all four cases especially in higher dimensions.","2164-7143;2164-7143;2164-7151","978-1-4673-5119-5978-1-4673-5117-1978-1-4673-5118","10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416590","Community Optimization;Collective Intelligence;Web Community;Behavioral Model;Knowledge Base","Communities;Knowledge based systems;Humans;Optimization;Benchmark testing;Encyclopedias;Birds","behavioural sciences;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;public domain software;Web sites","community optimization algorithm;Web-technology supported human community members;collective intelligence systems;Wikipedia;Web encyclopedia;function optimization;CO;collaborative Web community simulation;article-base editing;article-base improvement;knowledge-base editing;knowledge-base improvement;human behavioral model;open source communities;benchmark problems","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, most of the reported tools enumerate their test cases by covering all t-interactions of parameters involved, which are also known as uniform strength interaction testing. Later on, variable strength interaction testing has been proposed to allow certain subsets to cover higher t-interactions. Nevertheless, this consideration is still insufficient to generate test cases based on actual interactions. In fact, recent researches claimed that neither uniform nor variable strength interaction testing is capable to exactly cover actual factors interaction. Recently, interaction testing based on input-output relationship is reported to accommodate the actual interactions for SUT. This approach claimed that the interaction testing should focus on those input combinations that affect a program output, rather than considering all possible input combinations. The problem of generating minimal test cases is considered NP-complete as no single strategy in input-output interaction testing can generate the most efficient test cases. Therefore, a non-deterministic input-output based relationship test data sets minimization strategy, TIOR, has been proposed in this paper. The benchmarking inputs that reported in the literatures have been executed on TIOR in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and TIOR generally gives competitive results against other strategies.","","978-1-61284-691-0978-1-61284-689-7978-1-61284-690","10.1109/ISCI.2011.5959020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959020","","Testing;Arrays;Software;Software engineering;Conferences;Software algorithms","minimisation;program testing","nondeterministic input-output interaction;interaction testing strategies;software system under test;uniform strength interaction testing;variable strength interaction testing;program output;NP-complete problem;TIOR;test data set minimization strategy","","1","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, real design optimization by electrical and PV engineers working to achieve maximum production for systems they are responsible for requires additional knowledge as to how these modules can be expected to perform under all expected field conditions and in the presence of real obstructions; often including necessary inter-row shading. This work provides, for the first time, detailed field calculations of module performance for two types of PV modules illustrating the detrimental production impact of inter-row shading. The research indicates that using photodiode sensors to provide critical solar data from dispersed locations on the modules could aid in the development of an optimization procedure for minimizing the negative aspects of this common phenomenon. Extension of this work to cover the majority of the many module types will enable engineers to adequately address inter-row shading when they attempt to maximize the size of a PV system for a given roof or ground mounted project. It is clear from these research results that the impacts of inter-row shading on module output and energy production performance are more significant than originally anticipated by current PV design software models and must be considered in future design programs. The research provides a PV module shading test protocol, proposed sensor array layout design and results of the analysis of inter-row module shading (up to one cell row) and cell row coverage (20% through 100% in 20% increments) showing how important and worthwhile this sensor system can be to forwarding the design efforts of engineers working with high voltage photovoltaic power modules.","","978-1-4244-4988-0978-1-4244-4989","10.1109/SAS.2010.5439398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439398","photodiode sensors;photovoltaic system design criteria;photovoltaic system optimization;module inter-row shading","Sensor arrays;Photodiodes;Sensor systems;Photovoltaic systems;Design optimization;System testing;Solar power generation;Design engineering;Production;Power engineering and energy","electrical engineering;photodiodes;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;sensor arrays;testing","photodiode sensor array design;photovoltaic system inter-row spacing optimization;simulated shading;in-situ testing;PV engineers;electrical engineers;energy production;current PV design software models;high voltage photovoltaic power modules","","1","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The behaviour of an RTES is not based solely on the interactions it might have with its surrounding environment, but also on the timing requirements it induces. As a result, ensuring that an RTES behaves correctly is non-trivial, especially after adding time as a new dimension to the complexity of the testing process. In previous research, we introduced a 'priority-based' approach which tested the logical and timing behaviour of an RTES modeled formally as UPPAAL Timed Automata (UTA). The 'priority-based' approach was based on producing sets of timed test traces by achieving timing constraints coverage according to three sets of priorities, namely boundary, out-boundary and in-boundary. In this paper, we introduce a new testing tool 'GeTeX' that deploys the ""priority-based"" testing approach. GeTeX is a complete testing tool which generates timed test-cases from UTA models and executes them on the System Under Test (SUT) to identify faults. In its current version, GeTeX supports Control Area Network (CAN) applications.","","978-0-7695-4379-6978-1-4577-0065","10.1109/ECBS.2011.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934805","Real-time embedded systems;real-time model-based testing;testing tool;CAN","Testing;Clocks;Timing;Automata;Real time systems;Cost accounting;Semantics","automata theory;controller area networks;embedded systems;program testing;software tools","GeTeX;real-time embedded system testing;CAN;priority-based approach;UPPAAL timed automata;timing constraints;out-boundary priority;in-boundary priority;priority-based testing;testing tool;system under test;control area network;boundary priority","","1","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Optimizing Constraint Solving to Better Support Symbolic Execution","I. Erete; A. Orso","NA; NA","2011 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops","","2011","","","310","315","Constraint solving is an integral part of symbolic execution, as most symbolic execution techniques rely heavily on an underlying constraint solver. In fact, the performance of the constraint solver used by a symbolic execution technique can considerably affect its overall performance. Unfortunately, constraint solvers are mostly used in a black-box fashion within symbolic execution, without leveraging any of the contextual and domain information available. Because constraint solvers are optimized for specific kinds of constraints and heavily based on heuristics, this leaves on the table many opportunities for optimizing the solvers' performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel optimization strategy that uses domain and contextual information to optimize the performance of constraint solvers during symbolic execution. We also present a study in which we assess the effectiveness of our and other related strategies when used within dynamic symbolic execution performed on real software. Our results are encouraging, they show that optimizing constraints based on domain and contextual information can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of constraint solving and ultimately benefit symbolic execution.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954425","symbolic execution;constraint solving","Concrete;Testing;Software;Context;Constraint optimization;Manuals","program testing","constraint solving optimisation;black-box fashion;dynamic symbolic execution","","10","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In real world, multiple optima are usually interested in and can give people multi-choices. Crowding-based differential evolution (CRDE) algorithm is a simple but very powerful for multimodal optimization. CRDE has good explorative ability to find the optima in search space. The main shortcoming of CRDE is the convergence speed is low. To welcome this, an improved CRDE with local search on the individuals nearest optima in the population is introduced. Local search uses Gaussian mutation whose mutation range decreases linearly with iteration. It makes refined search in the area around the optima and improves the exploitable ability. To identify the best individuals around the optima in the current population, the idea of specifying the seeds of species (i.e. the best individuals in niches) in species-based particle swam optimization (SPSO) is adapted. The introduced algorithm is tested on multimodal benchmark problems CRDE used and the test shows it outperforms CRDE in convergence speed greatly.","","978-1-4244-8165-1978-1-4244-8162-0978-1-4244-8164","10.1109/ICECENG.2011.6057739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6057739","multimodal optimization;differential Evolution;local search;crowding scheme","Optimization;Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Euclidean distance","convergence of numerical methods;demography;differential equations;Gaussian processes;iterative methods;particle swarm optimisation;search problems","improved crowding-based differential evolution;multimodal optimization;multiple optima;search space;Gaussian mutation;iteration method;species-based particle swam optimization;multimodal benchmark problem;CRDE","","2","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method recovers the performance of the system through cleaning the internal state of system. Now component-oriented programming concept has been proposed and spreaded. And software system based on component emerges. These components with different function not only promote software reusability and self-management but also software reliability and availability. This paper demonstrates a software rejuvenation model based on resource-aware component optimized scheduling to realize software rejuvenation and avoid system crashing. In this paper we give the Lagrangian Relaxation component scheduling algorithm under single constrained condition and multi constrained condition. Then we test the algorithm and evaluate the model. Comparing system reboot, this rejuvenation model reduces MTTR (mean time to recover) very much.

Identifying such combinations can facilitate the debugging effort, e.g., by reducing the scope of the code that needs to be inspected. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying failure-inducing combinations, i.e., combinations that have caused some tests to fail. Given a t-way test set, our approach first identifies and ranks a set of suspicious combinations, which are candidates that are likely to be failure-inducing combinations. Next, it generates a set of new tests, which can be executed to refine the ranking of suspicious combinations in the next iteration. This process can be repeated until a stopping condition is satisfied. We conducted an experiment in which our approach was applied to several benchmark programs.

The resulting test cases are able to detect whether the faults in the mutated models have been implemented in the system under test. For this purpose, a conformance check between the original and the mutated model is required. We have developed an approach for conformance checking of action systems, which are well-suited to specify reactive and non-deterministic systems. We rely on constraint solving techniques. Both, the conformance relation and the transition relation are encoded as constraint satisfaction problems.

"An Interval-Based Model for Detecting Software Defect Using Alias Analysis","H. Zhou; D. Jin; Y. Gong","NA; NA; NA","2012 19th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference","","2012","2","","136","144","Alias analysis is a branch of static program analysis aiming at computing variables which are alias of each other. It is a basis research for many analyses and optimizations in software engineering and compiler construction. Precise modeling of alias analysis is fundamental for software analysis. This paper presents two practical approximation models for representing and computing alias: memory-sensitive model (MSM) and value-sensitive model (VSM). Based on defect-oriented detecting, we present a method to detect software defect using VSM and MSM, which realizes inter-procedure detecting by procedure summary. According to whether type of analysis object coming from defect is value-sensitive or memory-sensitive, we propose two detecting algorithms based on two alias models respectively. One is for memory leak (ML) based on MSM, and the other is for invalid arithmetic operation (IAO) based on VSM. We apply a defect testing system (DTS) to detect six C++ open source projects for proving our models effectiveness. Experimental results show that applying our technique to detect IAO and ML defect can improve detecting efficiency, at the same time reduce potential false positives and false negatives.","1530-1362;1530-1362;1530-1362","978-1-4673-4930-7978-0-7695-4922","10.1109/APSEC.2012.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462792","static analysis;defect detection;alias analysis;interval computation;procedure summary","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Algorithm design and analysis;Software;Abstracts;Argon;Automata","approximation theory;C++ language;program compilers;program diagnostics;software engineering","interval-based model;software defect detection;alias analysis;static program analysis;software engineering optimization;compiler construction optimization;software analysis;approximation model;memory-sensitive model;value-sensitive model;defect-oriented detecting;interprocedure detection;invalid arithmetic operation;defect testing system;C++ open source project","","3","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular we suggest that source code containing Duplicated Code is likely to be associated with more faults than source code containing the other five Code Bad Smells. As a consequence, Duplicated Code should be prioritised for refactoring. Source code containing Message Chains seems to be associated with a high number of faults in some situations. Consequently it is another Code Bad Smell which should be prioritised for refactoring. Source code containing only one of the Data Clumps, Switch Statements, Speculative Generality, or Middle Man Bad Smell is not likely to be fault-prone.

The series resonant test device can be used as an effective solution. In this paper, a PD test circuit of high-voltage reactor based on the series resonant theory is designed. First, the frequency-dependent impedance (30-300 Hz) of the high-voltage reactor is calculated by the finite element analysis software. By the comparing of the calculated results with the testing results, this method has been proved to be correct. According to the results, the appropriate parameters of resonant capacitor and compensation capacitor can be identified; then the sensitivity analysis model is established, and the sensitivity of the circuits is calculated by means of the network method to optimize the parameters of high-voltage filter and the detect impedance.

In early design phases, even when there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of the requirements, valuable information can be gained from models that describe the expected usage and the desired system reaction. The generation of test cases from these models indicates the feasibility of the intended solution and helps to identify scenarios for which the realization is hardly feasible or the intended system behavior is not properly defined. In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system. These so called usage models can be enriched by information about the desired system reaction. Thus, they are the basis for all subsequent testing activities: First, they can be used to verify the first implementation models and design decisions w.r.t. the fulfillment of requirements and second, test cases can be derived in a random or statistic manner. The generation can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities. Test cases were generated from the usage models to assess the implementation models in MATLAB/Simulink.

"Ramp Rate Constrained Unit Commitment by Improved Priority List and Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization","W. Ge","NA","2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","","2010","","","1","8","This paper proposes a new approach to solve ramp rate constrained unit commitment (RUC) problem by improving the method of particle swarm optimization, namely improved priority list and enhanced particle swarm optimization (IPL-EPSO). The IPL-EPSO proposed in this paper is a combination of improved priority list (IPL) and enhanced particle swarm optimization (EPSO), which decomposes UC problem into two sub-optimization problems and solves them respectively. The IPL is applied to solve unit scheduling problem, considering power balance constraint, system reverse constraint, start-up/shut-down ramp rate constraint, operation ramp rate constraint and minimum up/down-time constraint, and hence the EPSO is used to solve ramp rate constrained economic dispatch (RED) problem, in order to provide specific solutions satisfying power balance constraint and ramp rate constraint. Such cooperation fully presents not only the advantage of intelligence algorithm for addressing NP-hard problem, but also the guiding effects of human knowledge, reducing the complexity of computation. Problem formulation, representation, parameter testing and the final simulation results for 10, 20, 40 generator-scheduling problems are represented. Results clearly show that IPL-EPSO is very competent in solving the UC problem in comparison to other existing methods using PSO or IPL.","","978-1-4244-5391-7978-1-4244-5392","10.1109/CISE.2010.5677043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677043","","Spinning;Generators;Indexes;Particle swarm optimization;Production;Economics;Hopfield neural networks","particle swarm optimisation;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling","ramp rate constrained unit commitment;particle swarm optimization;IPL-EPSO;improved priority list;unit scheduling problem;ramp rate constrained economic dispatch;NP-hard problem","","5","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Source-level simulation models can be easily integrated into SystemC based simulation environment for fast simulation of complex multiprocessor systems. The accurate back-annotation of the timing information relies on the mapping between source code and binary code. The compiler optimizations might make it hard to get accurate mapping information. This paper addresses the mapping problems caused by complex compiler optimizations, which are the main source of simulation errors. To obtain accurate mapping information, we propose a method called fine-grained flow mapping that establishes a mapping between sequences of control flow of source code and binary code. In case that the code structure of a program is heavily altered by compiler optimizations, we propose to replace the altered part of the source code with functionally-equivalent IR-level code which has an optimized structure, leading to Partly Optimized Source Code (POSC). Then the flow mapping can be established between the POSC and the binary code and the timing information is back-annotated to the POSC. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy and speed of simulation models generated by our approach.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8978-3-9810801-8","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176501","","Timing;Optimization;Binary codes;Accuracy;Instruments;Debugging;Transforms","C++ language;digital simulation;multiprocessing systems;program compilers","source-level simulation model;embedded software;compiler optimizations;source code instrumentation;software simulation models;timing information back-annotation;application source code;SystemC based simulation environment;complex multiprocessor system simulation;source code-binary code mapping;fine-grained flow mapping;source code-binary code control flow;IR-level code;partly optimized source code;POSC","","3","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inaccuracy and static nature of existing fault localization methods prompt us to incorporate user feedback to improve the accuracy of the existing methods. In this paper, we propose an interactive fault localization framework that leverages simple user feedback. Our framework only needs users to label the statements examined as faulty or clean, which does not require additional effort than conventional non-interactive methods. After users label suspicious program elements as faulty or clean, our framework incorporates such information and re-orders the rest of the suspicious program elements, aiming to expose truly faulty elements earlier.

So, reliability analysis has been delayed until system testing or operation where principal design decisions had been already made. Also, they normally focus on estimating the reliability of the whole system rather than finding out unreliable sources or components. In this paper, we propose a UML model based white box reliability prediction methodology. The proposed methodology provides the capability of reliability prediction in the early phase by utilizing design artifacts like UML model, and by analyzing the probability of failure in three different levels of the system. Hence, it makes possible to rank the unreliable parts of the system quantitatively not only at the component level but also at the user's system usage level and system's activity level. In order to validate the proposed method, we performed a case study with safety-critical embedded software and compare the results with traditional reliability models. The result of proposed methodology shows the better prediction accuracy as well as the more detailed analysis of the unreliable part of the system.","","978-1-4577-0781-0978-0-7695-4454","10.1109/SSIRI-C.2011.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004517","Software reliability;Architecture based reliability;software reliability prediction;White-box Reliability Model;Component based reliability;UML model","Software reliability;Unified modeling language;Software;Insulin;Probability;Predictive models","formal specification;object-oriented programming;probability;safety-critical software;systems analysis;Unified Modeling Language","UML model;white box reliability prediction;unreliable component identify;reliability analysis;run-time information;software system reliability assessment;system testing;design artifacts;failure probability;user system usage level;system activity level;safety-critical embedded software;system analysis","","4","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the predictability and convergence of genetic algorithm optimum BP neural network, the multi-stress accelerated life model of genetic neural network is built. Take the level and reliability of accelerated stress in the accelerated life test as neural network input, then draw the scatter diagram by software and use the nonlinear least square to fit raw data to obtain the regression equation. Consequently, generate large quantities of test data, which shall be input into the neural network and optimize the weight and threshold value by genetic algorithm. By this means, conquer the blindness in selecting the original weight and threshold value. Finally, input constant stress and set reliability into well-trained network, thus get the predicting curve of reliability. Simulation results show that the method above is efficient and practical.","","978-1-4673-2092-4978-0-7695-4750","10.1109/BIFE.2012.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305068","Reliability;Accelerated Life Test;BP Neural Network;Genetic Algorithm","Stress;Life estimation;Mathematical model;Neural networks;Reliability;Genetic algorithms;Equations","backpropagation;convergence of numerical methods;genetic algorithms;least squares approximations;life testing;mechanical engineering computing;neural nets;nonlinear equations;product life cycle management;regression analysis;reliability;stress analysis","multistress accelerated life test;pluralism likelihood equations;genetic algorithm optimum BP neural network;convergence;predictability;scatter diagram;nonlinear least squares;regression equation;weight optimization;threshold value optimization;constant stress;reliability predicting curve","","","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a software update service with self-protection capabilities against unverified system updates - thus solving the integration problem in-system. As modern embedded systems may evolve through software updates, component replacement or even self-optimization, possible system configurations are hard to predict. Thus the designer of system updates does not know the exact system configuration. This turns the proof of system feasibility into a critical challenge. This paper presents the architecture of a framework and associated protocols enabling updates in embedded systems while ensuring safe operation w.r.t. non-functional properties. The proposed process employs contract based principles at the interfaces towards applications to perform an in-system verification.

By analyzing the optimal solution of the quadratic subscripts with the indexes bounds constraints, a new nonlinear dependence test was proposed.

Impact force and behavior of jets play a vital role on effect of water jet billet descaling. The parameters of nozzles and jet determine the characteristics of jetting. Some of these parameters, however, can only be obtained through experimentation. The mechanism of high-pressure water jet billet descaling was analyzed in this paper. The factors affecting billet descaling were also discussed. Furthermore, theoretical formula accounting for water jet impact force was derived from the discussion. An indoor test set-up investigating impact properties of water jet descaling nozzles was established. Virtual instrument Lab VIEW was combined with mathematics software MATLAB to develop a measuring system of the test set-up. The real-time test of descaling nozzles parameters can be achieved through the system. The measuring system included three modules: pressure-flow curve, three-dimensional platform movement track and jet impact force measurement. Various parameters of the nozzles and jet can be obtained by means of the modules. Experimental results were compared with theoretical ones and observations were made regarding the variation of parameters. Results showed that variation of the parameters yielded by experiments agreed well with theoretical prediction. Variation of each parameter was visually depicted. The impact force and behavior of the jet were accurately measured.

Choosing a P2P architecture, however, has significant constraints on the requirements of a given software engineering process in terms of security, reliability and performance. In addition, requirements for P2P architectures have to be expressed in notions of network engineering, because these architectures rank from the application layer to the IP networklayer. Thus, engineering P2P systems is a cross-disciplinary task between software and network engineers. We explain the ramifications P2P applications have on requirements of a given software engineering problem. A structured method supports software engineers in understanding the constraints of different kinds of P2P architectures and protocols on requirements.

Nowadays, numerous attacks made by the malware pose a major security threat to computer users. Unfortunately, along with the development of the malware writing techniques, the number of file samples that need to be analyzed, named ""gray list,"" on a daily basis is constantly increasing. In order to help our virus analysts, quickly and efficiently pick out the malicious executables from the ""gray list,"" an automatic and robust tool to analyze and classify the file samples is needed. In our previous work, we have developed an intelligent malware detection system (IMDS) by adopting associative classification method based on the analysis of application programming interface (API) execution calls. Despite its good performance in malware detection, IMDS still faces the following two challenges: (1) handling the large set of the generated rules to build the classifier; and (2) finding effective rules for classifying new file samples. In this paper, we first systematically evaluate the effects of the postprocessing techniques (e.g., rule pruning, rule ranking, and rule selection) of associative classification in malware detection, and then, propose an effective way, i.e., CIDCPF, to detect the malware from the ""gray list."" To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort on using postprocessing techniques of associative classification in malware detection. CIDCPF adapts the postprocessing techniques as follows: first applying Chi-square testing and Insignificant rule pruning followed by using Database coverage based on the Chi-square measure rule ranking mechanism and Pessimistic error estimation, and finally performing prediction by selecting the best First rule. We have incorporated the CIDCPF method into our existing IMDS system, and we call the new system as CIMDS system. Case studies are performed on the large collection of file samples obtained from the Antivirus Laboratory at Kingsoft Corporation and promising experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency and ability of detecting malware from the ""gray list"" of our CIMDS system outperform popular antivirus software tools, such as McAfee VirusScan and Norton Antivirus, as well as previous data-mining-based detection systems, which employed Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and decision tree techniques. In particular, our CIMDS system can greatly reduce the number of generated rules, which makes it easy for our virus analysts to identify the useful ones.","1094-6977;1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2037978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415575","Associative classification;malware detection;postprocessing;rule pruning;rule ranking;rule selection","Face detection;Software design;Computer viruses;Computer worms;Computer security;Writing;Robustness;Intelligent systems;Testing;Databases","associative processing;data mining;invasive software","intelligent malware detection system;malware writing techniques;computer virus;gray list;associative classification method;application programming interface;postprocessing techniques;Chi-square testing;insignificant rule pruning;rule ranking mechanism;Pessimistic error estimation;data mining;CIMDS system","","37","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Reusing such gray-box components can result in integration faults that can be difficult to diagnose and locate. In this paper, we present Behavior Capture and Test (BCT), a technique that uses dynamic analysis to automatically identify the causes of failures and locate the related faults. BCT augments dynamic analysis techniques with model-based monitoring. In this way, BCT identifies a structured set of interactions and data values that are likely related to failures (failure causes), and indicates the components and the operations that are likely responsible for failures (fault locations). BCT advances scientific knowledge in several ways. It combines classic dynamic analysis with incremental finite state generation techniques to produce dynamic models that capture complementary aspects of component interactions. It uses an effective technique to filter false positives to reduce the effort of the analysis of the produced data. It defines a strategy to extract information about likely causes of failures by automatically ranking and relating the detected anomalies so that developers can focus their attention on the faults. The effectiveness of BCT depends on the quality of the dynamic models extracted from the program. BCT is particularly effective when the test cases sample the execution space well. In this paper, we present a set of case studies that illustrate the adequacy of BCT to analyze both regression testing failures and rare field failures. The results show that BCT automatically filters out most of the false alarms and provides useful information to understand the causes of failures in 69 percent of the case studies.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2010.93","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611554","Dynamic Analysis;diagnosis;fault localization;false positive filters;regression failure analysis;field failure analysis.","Automata;Monitoring;Analytical models;Engines;Software;Testing;Inference algorithms","fault diagnosis;object-oriented programming;program testing;software fault tolerance","software components;Integration Faults;behavior capture and test technique;BCT;dynamic analysis;model-based monitoring;incremental finite state generation techniques","","32","71","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Using modern ANSI C development tools to increase productivity and ensure test and measurement application reliability","A. Kruger","National Instruments, Austin, TX","2010 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","","2010","","","1","3","Over the past few decades, the ANSI C language has become one of the most popular test and measurement programming languages due to its power and flexibility. ANSI C applications can be optimized for improved performance because of the developer's ability to have low level control through direct access to memory and hardware specific function calls. Although the ANSI C language provides low level control of application development resulting in the freedom to optimize source code for improved execution performance, it can also lead to programming mistakes. Some examples of the most common ANSI C programming mistakes are syntax errors, incorrect array indexing, memory leaks and inefficient function implementation, which can cause sluggish execution speeds on deployed test systems. Unlike high-level language developers, ANSI C developers are challenged with the added responsibility of ensuring that low level details are handled appropriately in order to ensure that applications are reliable and stable. Modern tools are becoming available to help ANSI C developers face these challenges and, often, integrate directly into existing development environments. This paper examines how and why ANSI C developers commonly make programming mistakes related to syntax, memory allocation and inefficiencies in application source code, and focuses on overcoming these challenges with modern development tools. Some of these modern ANSI C development tools include run-time debugging, resource tracking and run-time analysis and help to increase developer productivity and ensure the reliability of test systems.","1558-4550;1088-7725;1088-7725","978-1-4244-7961-0978-1-4244-7960-3978-1-4244-7959","10.1109/AUTEST.2010.5613623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613623","","Debugging;Programming;Instruments;Productivity;Level control;Reliability;Hardware","ANSI standards;automatic test equipment;C language;program debugging;software reliability","modern ANSI C development tool;measurement application reliability;test application;ANSI C language;measurement programming language;direct access memory;hardware specific function call;source code optimization;syntax error;incorrect array indexing;memory leak;programming mistake;run time debugging;resource tracking;run time analysis","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such applications are important to many organizations, but are often difficult to change and consequently prone to regression faults during maintenance. They also tend to be built without particular considerations for testability and can be hard to control and observe. We have therefore devised a practical solution for functional regression testing that captures the changes in database state (due to data manipulations) during the execution of a system under test. The differences in changed database states between consecutive executions of the system under test, on different system versions, can help identify potential regression faults. In order to make the regression test approach scalable for large, complex database applications, classification tree models are used to prioritize test cases. The test case prioritization can be applied to reduce test execution costs and analysis effort. We report on how DART was applied and evaluated on business critical batch jobs in a legacy database application in an industrial setting, namely the Norwegian Tax Accounting System (SOFIE) at the Norwegian Tax Department (NTD).

A method-size and execution-time heuristic algorithm is proposed in the study. The key principle of the algorithm is that different method-sizes necessitate different compile thresholds for optimal performance. A parameter search mechanism using a genetic algorithm for dynamic compilation is proposed to find optimised multi-thresholds in the algorithm.

The proposed technology has been validated by the experimental results on larger ITC'99 benchmark circuits.","2153-697X;2153-6961;2153-6961","978-1-4244-7516-2978-1-4244-7515-5978-1-4244-7514","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722300","","Testing;Entropy;Clocks;Safety;Switches;Logic gates","semiconductor device testing;VLSI","compression-aware capture power reduction;VLSI testing;X-fllling framework;LoC at-speed testing;LoS at-speed testing;test compression schemes","","","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the low computational ability in the embedded environment, a large amount of waiting time usually makes the human-machine interface not friendly. This paper presents a hardware and software (HW/SW) co-design solution for fast-trainable speaker identification system. Fast training ability makes this embedded speaker identification system possess high flexibility and enhances the convenience to a wide range of real-world applications. The proposed system consists of a training phase and a multiclass identification phase. The sequential minimal optimization (SMO) training algorithm occupies the heaviest computational load and is realized as a dedicated VLSI module, i.e., the hardware component. The other processes such as speech preprocess, speech feature extraction, and SVM voting strategy are implemented by software. Moreover, a data-packed mechanism is presented to improve the bandwidth utilization. Compared with the embedded C code based on ARM processor, our system reduces 90% of the training time and achieves 89.9% identification rate with the NIST 2010 speaker recognition database.

"Verifying Code and Its Optimizations: An Experience Report","R. Metta","NA","2011 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops","","2011","","","578","583","We present our experience in formally verifying the correctness of a 200-line industrial C implementation of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and its optimizations. Our experience indicates that (a) both the specification and verification of even such small code can be hard to automate and needs intense manual effort, and (b) verifying certain optimizations to an existing code is relatively easier. It took us 10 days to specify and 5 days verify the correctness of this 200 line program. Our initial attempt to verify the correctness, using the model checker CBMC, did not scale up due to a huge loop unwinding (220 times). Since it is hard to scale model checking for such huge loops, we first verified each function's correctness independently using CBMC and then verified the correctness of the loop through manual application of induction using CBMC. This traditional modular and inductive approach helped CBMC verify the implementation within 25 seconds. Furthermore, the implementation was poorly coded to begin with and had to undergo several optimizations to meet its performance requirement. With our optimizations, the CRC implementation met its performance requirement. Due to the changes in code for the optimizations, we needed to reverify the complete implementation. To lessen the verification rework, we proved one optimization at a time, in each function, by proving that the behavior of the function is preserved by the optimization. It took us 7 days to code the optimizations and 1 day to verify them. This optimized correct implementation was accepted and shipped by our client along with the client's automotive software. In future, we would like to generalize this approach to verify behavior preserving changes, and we believe that some of these steps can be automated.","","978-0-7695-4345-1978-1-4577-0019","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954468","verification;code;scalability;evolution","Optimization;Polynomials;Computational modeling;Software;Automotive engineering;Manuals;Generators","cyclic redundancy check codes;formal specification;program verification","code verification;code optimization;formal verification;industrial C implementation;cyclic redundancy check;code specification;CBMC model checker;correctness verification;modular approach;inductive approach;automotive software","","2","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The score can be used to indicate early trend for chronic abnormalities and thus results in an effective wellness measure. Many of these chronic abnormalities have a late manifestation and are major contributors for healthcare cost and mortality. Resources of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) are introduced for automatic generation of relational tree between laboratory test, disease and organs with relative rank. Doctor's annotations are used to create reference score and data mining techniques are employed in deriving a mathematical model for estimating the DT-Score. A novel human body based summarization is employed for an intuitive view of the DT-Score and resultant temporal state of the associated organ. The proposed method enables an efficient temporal summarization of high volume of laboratory data and eventually reduces the cognitive load on physician.

However, existing SLS approaches still can not guarantee to find a matching for a CFG that is optimized by the compiler. Further, they rely on debug information, which may be unreliable. In this paper, the authors propose a hierarchical CFG matching approach to reduce the influence of compiler optimization and ambiguous debug information. This approach divides the CFGs of the source and binary code into nested regions. Then the matching of those two CFGs is performed for the regions in a top-down manner. In this way, heavy optimization or debug misinformation of certain basic blocks will not have global impact on the matching of other basic blocks. Moreover, optimized loops and branches are matched with respect to the optimization techniques used by the compiler.","","978-1-4673-2896-8978-1-4673-2895-1978-1-4673-2894","10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6376366","","Optimization;Binary codes;Timing;Embedded software;Design automation;Benchmark testing","binary codes;flow graphs;optimisation;program compilers;program control structures;program debugging;source coding","hierarchical control flow matching;source-level simulation;embedded software;control flow graphs;cross-compiled binary code;SLS approaches;hierarchical CFG matching approach;compiler optimization;ambiguous debug information;binary code CFG;source code CFG;nested regions;loop optimization;branch optimization;optimization techniques","","4","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the quality models have not included comprehensively this aspect together with the behavioural aspect of software quality. This research has proposed a Pragmatic Quality Factors (or PQF) as a software quality measurement and metrics that includes both aspects of quality. These aspects of quality are essential as to balance between technical and non-technical (human) facet. In addition, this model provides flexibility by giving priorities and weights to the quality attributes.

RBT enables services to assess the trust level of other services based on the reputation accumulated from user recommendations. A key challenge to apply RBT is to prevent the strategic behavior of users when they provide recommendations - they might give unfair ratings to benefit themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural approach to integrating auction mechanisms into the trust framework to prevent benefits from untruthful incentives. In this architecture we define an auction-based trust negotiation protocol and realize it in the trust framework. The contribution of our architecture is that it scales and produces accurate results to achieve protection against untruthful incentives, especially when a majority of ratings are unfair, without the potential increase in a computation overhead.

Firstly, based on the installation requirement of devices and connection requirement of the support and the carrier, the initial structure of the support is designed. Topology optimization with FEA software ANSYS is adopted on the initial structure to get the basic one. Then 5 critical sizes are chosen as design variables, and the support structure is optimized by means of size optimization to reach light weight with satisfying the requirement of dynamic stiffness. Finally, random vibration analysis is applied to the initial structure. In the mean time, random vibration test is carried out to qualify the analysis method. After the qualification, a random vibration analysis is applied to the optimized support structure to get the rms of displacement response and acceleration response of the support to validate whether the optimized structure is appropriate. The results indicate that the dynamic stiffness of the optimized support structure satisfies the design requirements, and its weight is lighter 49.38% than that of the initial one.

"Using Dependability Benchmarks to Support ISO/IEC SQuaRE","J. Friginal; D. d. Andres; J. Ruiz; R.

This selection process, typically named benchmarking, requires evaluating the behaviour of eligible components in operation, and ranking them attending to quality characteristics. Most existing benchmarks only provide measures characterising the behaviour of software systems in absence of faults ignoring the hard impact that both accidental and malicious faults have on software quality. However, since using COTS to build a system may motivate the emergence of dependability issues due to the interaction between components, benchmarking the system in presence of faults is essential. The recent ISO/IEC 25045 standard copes with this lack by considering accidental faults when assessing the recoverability capabilities of software systems. This paper proposes a dependability benchmarking approach to determine the impact that faults (noted as disturbances in the standard) either accidental or malicious may have on the quality features exhibited by software components. As will be shown, the usefulness of the approach embraces all evaluator profiles (developers, acquirers and third-party evaluators) identified in the ISO/IEC 25000 ""SQuaRE"" standard. The feasibility of the proposal is finally illustrated through the benchmarking of three distinct software components, which implement the OLSR protocol specification, competing for integration in a wireless mesh network.","","978-1-4577-2005-5978-0-7695-4590","10.1109/PRDC.2011.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133063","Dependability Benchmarking;Quality Evaluation;ISO/IEC SQuaRE","Benchmark testing;ISO standards;IEC standards;Software measurement;Software quality;Time measurement","benchmark testing;IEC standards;ISO standards;software quality;software reliability","ISO/IEC SQuaRE;commercial-off-the-shelf component;time-to-market;production cost;selection process;software quality system;COTS;ISO/IEC 25045 standard;accidental fault;recoverability capability;software system;dependability benchmarking;quality feature;software component;OLSR protocol specification;wireless mesh network","","3","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The efficiency of the selected software-based solution must be assessed. This evaluation process allows the designers to choose the more suitable robustness technique and check if the hardened system achieves the expected dependability levels. Several approaches with this purpose can be found in the literature, but their efficiency is limited in terms of the number of faults that can be injected, as well as the level of accuracy of the fault injection process.

To reduce product cost for disposable biochips, testing steps and functional fluidic operations must be implemented on pin-constrained designs. However, previous testing methods for pin-constrained designs do not optimize test schedules to reduce the number of control pins and test/assay completion time. We propose a pin-count-aware online testing method for pin-constrained designs to support the execution of both fault testing and the target bioassay protocol. The proposed method interleaves fault testing with the target bioassay protocol for online testing. It is aimed at significantly reducing the completion time for testing and for the bioassay, while keeping the number of control pins small. Two practical applications, namely a multiplexed bioassay and an interpolation-based mixing protocol, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2375-1053;1093-0167;1093-0167","978-1-4244-6650-4978-1-4244-6649-8978-1-4244-6648","10.1109/VTS.2010.5469602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5469602","","Testing;Microfluidics;Pins;Protocols;Design automation;Design methodology;Biomedical electrodes;Drugs;Application software;Fault detection","fault diagnosis;lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics;testing;VLSI","pin-count-aware online testing;digital microfluidic biochip;defect detection;fluidic abnormality detection;bioassay malfunction detection;disposable biochip;fault testing;target bioassay protocol","","4","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Quality of service profiling","S. Misailovic; S. Sidiroglou; H. Hoffmann; M. Rinard","MIT CSAIL; MIT CSAIL; MIT CSAIL; MIT CSAIL","2010 ACM/IEEE 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering","","2010","1","","25","34","Many computations exhibit a trade off between execution time and quality of service. A video encoder, for example, can often encode frames more quickly if it is given the freedom to produce slightly lower quality video. A developer attempting to optimize such computations must navigate a complex trade-off space to find optimizations that appropriately balance quality of service and performance. We present a new quality of service profiler that is designed to help developers identify promising optimization opportunities in such computations. In contrast to standard profilers, which simply identify time-consuming parts of the computation, a quality of service profiler is designed to identify subcomputations that can be replaced with new (and potentially less accurate) subcomputations that deliver significantly increased performance in return for acceptably small quality of service losses. Our quality of service profiler uses loop perforation (which transforms loops to perform fewer iterations than the original loop) to obtain implementations that occupy different points in the performance/quality of service trade-off space. The rationale is that optimizable computations often contain loops that perform extra iterations, and that removing iterations, then observing the resulting effect on the quality of service, is an effective way to identify such optimizable subcomputations. Our experimental results from applying our implemented quality of service profiler to a challenging set of benchmark applications show that it can enable developers to identify promising optimization opportunities and deliver successful optimizations that substantially increase the performance with only small quality of service losses.","1558-1225;0270-5257","978-1-60558-719","10.1145/1806799.1806808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062070","loop perforation;profiling;quality of service","Quality of service;Optimization;Benchmark testing;Distortion measurement;Manuals;Mathematical model","iterative methods;optimisation;quality of service;software metrics;software performance evaluation;software quality","service profiling quality;execution time;video encoder;quality of service profiler;loop perforation;benchmark applications;optimization opportunities","","30","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For famous open source systems, the number of daily submitted bug reports is very high. Unfortunately, as most of bug reports were not assigned to appropriate developers for fixing related bugs, these bug reports need to be reassigned. A larger number of reassignments cause the time of bug fixing to increase and the fixing probability to decrease. In order to resolve this problem, it is necessary to recommend appropriate developers for fixing bugs. In this paper, we propose a new developer recommendation method for assigning appropriate developers to fix bugs. This method, based on social network and experts' feedback, recommends some candidate developers. We also consider the fixing efficiency and the experience of these candidate developers to rank the candidate developers. We have validated our approach on the famous software bug repository and showed the feasibility and availability of the method by experiments.","0730-3157;0730-3157;0730-3157","978-1-4673-1990-4978-0-7695-4736","10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6340140","bug fixing;social network;fixing efficiency;feedback;developer recommendation;reassignment","Social network services;Computer bugs;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Testing;Software","probability;program debugging;public domain software;software maintenance","bug fixing;software size;software complexity;software maintenance;software developer;open source system;bug report;fixing probability;developer recommendation method;fixing efficiency;software bug repository","","","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Chen","NA; NA; NA","2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","","2011","","","609","614","Translation Look aside Buffers (TLBs) have a significant impact on system performance. Numerous prior studies focus on TLBs design for uniprocessors. As the advent of chip multiprocessors (CMPs), we need shift to TLBs for chip multiprocessors. This paper presents a software-implemented level-two TLB -- SL2-TLB which is a shared level-two TLB for multiprocessors. It not only reduces the cost of TLB refill handler for every processor core, but also reduces the redundant TLB misses' cost for CMPs effectively. Today, CMPs typically employ private per-core TLBs. SL2-TLB together with the hardware TLBs make up a software-hardware co-designed multilevel TLB system which brings great benefit to system performance while avoiding changing the hardware TLB. So it is a convenient and efficient method for CMPs' TLB performance improvement. The benefit brought by SL2-TLB to SPECCPU2000 is less than that to SPECCPU2006, about 5% and 7% separately. Therein to, the average performance improvement of SPECint 2006 reaches about 12.7%. That is because the overhead for TLB refill is small when the cache is large enough to avoid a miss as walking the page table of applications with small memory footprints. The further optimization for SL2-TLB is kept the SL2-TLB table stay in L2 cache forever by the cache locking scheme. SL2-TLB together with cache locking scheme improves the performances by over 13% for SPECint 2006. And an average performance improvement of over 7% is brought to the new emerging parallel benchmark suite-Princeton Application Repository for Shared-Memory Computers (PARSEC). And all the above evaluations are done on Godson-3 processors which is the latest generation of China's most powerful microprocessor family.","","978-1-4577-0383-6978-0-7695-4388","10.1109/CIT.2011.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036833","Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs);Software-implemented shared level-two TLB;parallel benchmarks;redundant TLB misses;Godson-3 processors","Benchmark testing;Hardware;Computers;Prefetching;Computer architecture;System performance;Kernel","cache storage;circuit optimisation;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips;paged storage;performance evaluation;shared memory systems","chip multiprocessor;software-hardware codesign;multilevel TLB design;translation lookaside buffer;CMP;TLB refill handler;processor core;software-implemented level-two TLB;SPECint 2006 performance improvement;memory footprints;page table;SL2-TLB optimization;L2 cache;cache locking scheme;parallel benchmark suite;Princeton application repository for shared-memory computers;PARSEC;Godson-3 processor","","","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Tool for performance tuning and regression analyses of HPC systems and applications","S. Merchant; G.

For example, tuning an application on a given platform to maximize performance requires playing with multitude of different optimization flags and environment variables. This is typically a highly repetitive and an ad hoc process of trying out different combinations of variable settings and manually comparing the results to find the optimal. Similar is the case for performance regression analyses of systems and applications, where one is interested in detecting performance regressions in the software version under test and analyzing the causes to fix issues. In both of these scenarios, the process involves creating a patchwork of scripts to deploy jobs, extract meaningful data from raw outputs, arrange this data in some reportable format to be able to analyze, and perform tweaks to enable subsequent iterations. When repeated over time, the ad-hoc process results in users re-writing similar set of scripts again and again for different applications, or architectures, or even new software builds on the same architecture resulting in significant wastage of productive man-hours. This paper presents JACE (Job Auto-creator and Executor), a tool that enables automation of creation and execution of complex functional and performance regression tests. JACE aims to address many pain points in performance engineering such as tedious scripting, parameter tuning, careful book-keeping, frequent debugging, assessing reliability of results, and comparative evaluation. The paper introduces the tool and describes its architecture and workflow. It also presents a sample walk-through of performance regression analyses using JACE.","","978-1-4673-2371-0978-1-4673-2372-7978-1-4673-2370","10.1109/HiPC.2012.6507528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6507528","Performance Regression;Performance Analysis;Application Tuning;Application Optimization;High Performance Computing","","parallel processing;program debugging;program testing;regression analysis;software architecture;software performance evaluation","performance tuning;regression analyses;HPC system;HPC applications;high performance computing;system architecture;user environment;application tuning;optimization flag;environment variables;performance regression analysis;software version under test;script patchwork;job deployment;data extraction;data analysis;ad-hoc process;script rewriting;software build;software architecture;JACE tool;Job Auto-creator and Executor;performance engineering;debugging;result reliability assessment;comparative evaluation","","1","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

WSN consists of a large number of low-cost, low-power, multifunctional sensor nodes to monitor physical conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion, etc. As the energy available in the sensor nodes used in WSN is limited, the primary focus of WSN applications is to maximize the network life time by using the energy efficiently. Hence making a good use of energy is important in WSN application. There are techniques to utilize the energy in an efficient way. One such technique is to place the sink node in an optimal position. The widely used technique for finding optimal location for sink node is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this paper, an efficient method for finding optimized position of sink node using PSO is proposed. The initial constraints in finding optimal Base-Station (BS) locations in two-tiered wireless sensor networks proposed by B. Paul et al. using PSO are relaxed by placing Application Nodes (AN) dynamically based on Euclidean distance and probability of selection. This system is tested by establishing communication between the nodes and sink through the application nodes using query-driven model of WSN. The energy spent in transmission, reception and processing of query is analyzed and the results are presented.","","978-81-909042-2-3978-1-4673-0213-5INAVLID IS","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215905","AN;BS;PSO;WSN","Wireless sensor networks;Mathematics;Temperature sensors;Particle swarm optimization;Robustness;Application software","particle swarm optimisation;wireless sensor networks","dynamic sink node placement;particle swarm optimization;life time maximization;WSN;wireless sensor network;wireless communication technology;low-cost sensor node;low-power sensor node;multifunctional sensor node;network life time;PSO;optimal base-station location;application nodes;Euclidean distance;query-driven model;query transmission;query reception;query processing","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Feature Location Using Data Mining on Existing Test-Cases","C. Ziftci; I. KrÃ¼ger","NA; NA","2012 19th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","","2012","","","155","164","Feature location is the mapping of features onto static artifacts such as source code and configuration files. Recent effective feature location methods use dynamic-analysis and scenarios, i.e. executable use-cases that represent features in source code. Almost all of these techniques require that a distinct scenario is created for every feature, which puts a great burden on developers due to the inherent manual work that needs to be carried out. First, since scenarios are typically created and exercised manually, the act of locating features is not easily repeatable as software evolves. Second, there may be dependencies between features, which will be reflected on the collected execution traces during scenario execution. For existing feature location methods to perform well, developers typically need to mark the execution traces manually to specify which parts of it exactly represent each feature. In this work, we free developers of the manual process of creating scenarios by using association rule learning on a set of labeled test-cases, i.e. test-cases labeled with the features they exercise in the existing test-suite of the system, to locate features in source code. We also provide an evaluation of our method on three case studies and compare it with a well-known feature location technique that uses probabilistic ranking. Our method achieves results within 83-97% of the probabilistic ranking method on the case studies without any need to create scenarios as in the existing dynamic-analysis based feature location techniques.","2375-5369;1095-1350","978-0-7695-4891-3978-1-4673-4536","10.1109/WCRE.2012.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385111","feature location;program features;data mining;program comprehension;software maintenance;reverse engineering","Association rules;Graphical user interfaces;Software;Reliability;Manuals;Servers","data mining;probability;software maintenance;system monitoring","feature location;data mining;test-cases;feature mapping;static artifact;source code;configuration file;dynamic analysis;software evolution;association rule learning;probabilistic ranking","","1","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on the use of SMT to represent possible problems caused by the use of Floating Point Comparison (FPC) since this feature of programming languages can lead to subtle errors. We describe six FPC semantic mutation operators that have been implemented in a C SMT tool. These operators mutate a C program by introducing tolerances using three different algorithms. The paper reports on the results of experiments that explored the proposed mutation operators. It was found that random test suites were not good at killing the resultant mutants, suggesting also that random test suites are poor at revealing FPC problems. We therefore devised a new approach to generate test data to kill these mutants. The manually generated test suites produced using the new approach were more effective in killing FPC mutants. In addition, the random test suites and manual test suites killed different sets of FPC mutants. The impact of using three different algorithms in FPC mutation was also investigated with no dominates relationships being found between the three types of FPC operators. Finally, we ran the same experiments on a computer with a different configuration. We found that slightly different sets of mutants were killed on the two computers, indicating that portability problems can be introduced by FPC.","2159-4848","978-0-7695-4670-4978-1-4577-1906","10.1109/ICST.2012.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200085","","Semantics;Libraries;Computers;Software;Optimization;Testing;Algorithm design and analysis","C language;program testing","semantic mutation analysis;floating-point comparison;semantic mutation testing;SMT;description language;programming languages;C program","","3","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They aim to replace instruction set simulators in virtual prototypes (VP) of embedded systems to improve simulation efficiency. In this work, a novel control flow mapping algorithm is presented to automatically generate timing annotations for instrumented software models. The method is based on the analysis of loop and control dependency properties of basic code blocks in the binary and source code control flow. With these properties, the method can find suitable positions to annotate the timing delay statements of binary code basic blocks into the source code. It shows high accuracy even in the case that the binary code is optimized during compilation. The paper also presents the novel idea of adding timing control statements into the source code to improve timing accuracy. The error in runtime estimation was found to be below 6% for standard test programs. A case study for a VP shows a gain in simulation efficiency of three orders of magnitude compared to an ISS based model.","","978-1-4577-1048","10.1109/DSD.2011.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6037466","Embedded software;source code instrumentation;TLM","Binary codes;Delay;Instruments;Program processors;Optimization","binary codes;embedded systems;instruction sets;program compilers;program control structures;program testing;source coding;virtual prototyping","control-flow-driven source level timing annotation;embedded software models;transaction level;instrumented software models;software functionality;timing information;execution times;embedded processors;instruction set simulators;virtual prototypes;VP;embedded systems;simulation efficiency;novel control flow mapping algorithm;timing annotations;loop dependency property;control dependency property;code blocks;binary code control flow;source code control flow;timing delay statements;binary code basic blocks;compilation;adding timing control statements;timing accuracy;runtime estimation;standard test programs;ISS based model","","13","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, developing web based systems has become a major concern for developers due to the large number of technologies, tools and techniques available today. Developers are often faced with the dilemma of choosing the best technology for their projects especially when developing a high quality system that must comply with certain standards. Enterprise developers often use development frameworks to simplify development job, and to insure that their code follows proven development methodologies. In this paper we describe our approach for developing an intelligent university program ranking system, using a JEE web application framework that has been developed utilizing industry standards and best practices. The development has been done using a well designed JEE web application framework and REpresentational State Transfer (REST) web services to minimize the development time and effort. The system which uses the powerful Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) algorithm for its AI engine is developed using the SEAM framework and RESTEasy web services framework. SEAM has been chosen due to its power and integration capabilities while RESTEasy framework is chosen for its seamless integration with JBoss SEAM. The developed system known as i-Selangkah is divided into two major components; a web based control panel to administer and modify the system as well as the programs fuzzy rules, and a web services interface to provide the existing Selangkah system with the ranking services. i-Selangkah has been successfully implemented, integrated and tested with the existing Selangkah system developed by UiTM. The tests showed that the system can effectively be used together with Selangkah to provide better program advising to these potential applicants with respect to their merit points, the specific and ever-changing program requirements and more significantly, the past intake trends.","","978-1-4673-1046-8978-1-4673-1044-4978-1-4673-1045","10.1109/ICOS.2012.6417618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6417618","Artificial Intelligence;Web based applications;program ranking;advisory system;web based application frameworks;ANFIS;Java;JEE;Restful Web Services;SEAM;RestEasy","Web services;Educational institutions;Testing;Java;Artificial intelligence;Standards","educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;Java;user interfaces;Web services","intelligent university program ranking system;Web based systems;software applications;high quality system;enterprise developers;JEE Web application framework;industry standards;representational state transfer Web services;adaptive neurofuzzy inference system algorithm;ANFIS algorithm;AI engine;SEAM framework;RESTEasy Web service framework;integration capabilities;seamless integration;JBoss SEAM;i-Selangkah;Web based control panel;fuzzy rules;Web service interface;i-Selangkah system;ranking services;UiTM;program requirements","","","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An embedded processor, typically working with a limited application domain, does not necessarily utilize the fixed, general-purpose data path interconnect efficiently. If we consider the interconnect to be a flexible resource, the data path can be fine tuned to an application domain. The addition of an interconnect link between two data path units has the potential to reduce execution time, while the removal of an unused link can save area and power dissipation. Finding the most energy-efficient data path interconnect configuration for a software application domain is a time-consuming process, since it involves rescheduling of the targeted application(s) on different data path implementations. We present an automated optimization engine that is based on a genetic algorithm. This engine aids the designer in finding the most energy-efficient interconnect configuration of a simple processor data path. We show that an optimized data path interconnect can offer an energy saving of 38% with respect to a general-purpose data path reference, if the interconnect links are matched to the need of one application.","2159-3477;2159-3469;2159-3469","978-1-4577-0803-9978-0-7695-4447","10.1109/ISVLSI.2011.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992523","Design Space Exploration;Application-Specific Energy Optimization;Genetic Algorithm;Optimization Engine;Fine-grained;Flexible;General-Purpose Datapath Interconnect","Biological cells;Energy dissipation;Optimization;Engines;Integrated circuit interconnections;Correlation;Benchmark testing","genetic algorithms;integrated circuit interconnections;microprocessor chips","application-specific energy optimization;general-purpose datapath interconnect;datapath units;power dissipation;energy-efficient datapath interconnect configuration;software application domain;automated optimization engine;genetic algorithm;general-purpose datapath reference;optimized datapath interconnect;interconnect links","","1","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing an integrated framework called GRoundTram, which is carefully designed and implemented for compositional development of well-behaved and efficient bidirectional model transformations. GRoundTram is built upon a well-founded bidirectional framework, and is equipped with a user-friendly language for coding bidirectional model transformation, a new tool for validating both models and bidirectional model transformations, an optimization mechanism for improving efficiency, and a powerful debugging environment for testing bidirectional behavior.

Recently, it was demonstrated that correlations among these metrics allow errors to be detected and their causes localized. Prior research shows that linear models can capture many of these correlations. However, our research shows that several factors may prevent linear models from accurately describing correlations, even if the underlying relationship is linear. Common phenomena we have observed include relationships that evolve, relationships with missing variables, and heterogeneous residual variance of the correlated metrics. Usually these phenomena can be discovered by testing for heteroscedasticity of the underlying linear models. Such behaviour violates the assumptions of simple linear regression, which thus fail to describe system dynamics correctly. In this paper we address the above challenges by employing efficient variants of Ordinary Least Squares regression models. In addition, we automate the process of error detection by introducing the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test after proper correlations modeling. We validate our models using a realistic Java-Enterprise-Edition application. Using fault-injection experiments we show that our improved models capture system behavior accurately.","1932-4537;2373-7379","","10.1109/TNSM.2011.120811.100033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102277","System monitoring;metric-correlation models;fault detection;recursive least squares;multi-variable correlations;heteroscedasticity","Correlation;Measurement;Monitoring;Computational modeling;Software systems;Adaptation models;Predictive models","error detection;least squares approximations;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;software metrics;system monitoring","system monitoring;metric-correlation model;software system management metrics;linear model;heterogeneous residual variance;heteroscedasticity testing;linear regression;system dynamics;ordinary least squares regression model;error detection;Wilcoxon rank-sum test;correlations modeling;Java-Enterprise-Edition application;fault injection experiment","","1","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Its functions include monitoring the cell/pack voltage, current, temperature, state-of-charge, depth-of-discharge, and state-of-health. Besides reporting this data to a supervisory (powertrain) controller, the BMS protects the battery by preventing it from operating outside its safe operating range and balancing the individual cells. Programming, testing and validation of the BMS with real batteries is a time-consuming, expensive and potentially dangerous operation since physical batteries needs to be discharged and re-charged for every development iteration. With the help of virtual batteries models as part of a HIL simulation, the BMS algorithm can be developed, calibrated and validated in a very secure and time-efficient manner resulting in a significant product development time reduction.","","978-1-4673-1561-6978-1-4673-1562","10.1109/IEVC.2012.6183235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6183235","Battry Management Systems;Hardware in-the-loop Simulation;Rapid Control Propotyping","Batteries;Vehicles;Computer architecture;Testing;Software;Threshold voltage;System-on-a-chip","battery management systems;battery powered vehicles;embedded systems;optimisation;power transmission (mechanical);secondary cells","HIL simulation;hardware-in-loop simulation;rapid control prototyping tools;battery management systems accelerated design;battery management systems optimization;hybrid-electric vehicles;electronic system;rechargeable battery pack;cell voltage;depth-of-discharge;state-of-health;supervisory controller;powertrain;BMS protection;physical batteries;virtual batteries models;BMS algorithm","","8","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many applications, the source dimensions, the matrix material and density may not be well known. Under such circumstances, the efficiencies may not be very accurate since the modeled source geometry may not be very representative of the measured geometry. CANBERRA developed an efficiency optimization software known as âAdvanced ISOCSâ that varies the not well known parameters within user specified intervals and determines the optimal efficiency shape and magnitude based on available benchmarks in the measured spectra. The benchmarks could be results from isotopic codes such as MGAU, MGA, IGA, or FRAM, activities from multi-line nuclides, and multiple counts of the same item taken in different geometries (from the side, bottom, top etc). The efficiency optimization is carried out using either a random search based on standard probability distributions, or using numerical techniques that carry out a more directed (referred to as âsmartâ in this paper) search. Measurements were carried out using representative source geometries and radionuclide distributions.

A unified approach for evaluating such algorithms allows a better comparison of their performance and can potentially lead to some optimizations.

As a result, pinpointing the subsystems that are the source of performance degradation for a load test in LSS can be frustrating, and might take several hours or even days. This is due to the large volume of performance counter data collected such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption and network traffic, the limited operational knowledge of analysts about all subsystems of an LSS and the unavailability of up-to-date documentation in a LSS. We have developed a methodology that automatically ranks the subsystems according to the deviation of their performance in a load test. Our methodology uses performance counter data of a load test to craft performance signatures for the LSS subsystems. Pair-wise correlations among the performance signatures of subsystems within a load test are compared with the corresponding correlations in a baseline test to pinpoint the subsystems responsible for the performance violations. Case studies on load test data obtained from a large telecom system and that of an open source benchmark application show that our approach provides an accuracy of 79% and do not require any instrumentation or domain knowledge to operate.","1071-9458;1071-9458;2332-6549","978-1-4244-9056-1978-0-7695-4255","10.1109/ISSRE.2010.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635038","Pinpointing;Performance Counters;Load Testing","Radiation detectors;Correlation;Testing;Servers;Generators;Principal component analysis;Databases","large-scale systems;performance evaluation;program testing","performance deviation;large scale system;load test;operational knowledge;user performance counter data;craft performance signature;pair wise correlation;open source benchmark;domain knowledge","","10","38","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that we can look at this problem, called Software Quality Assessment (SQA), as a multicriteria decision-making problem. Indeed, just like software is assessed along different criteria, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is about decisions that are based on several criteria that are usually conflicting and non-homogenously satisfied. Nonadditive (fuzzy) measures along with the Choquet integral can be used to model and aggregate the levels of satisfaction of these criteria by considering their relationships. However, in practice, fuzzy measures are difficult to identify. An automated process is necessary and possible when sample data is available. Several optimization approaches have been proposed to extract fuzzy measures from sample data; e.g., genetic algorithms, gradient descent algorithms, and the Bees algorithm, all local search techniques. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach, combining the Bees algorithm and an interval constraint solver, resulting in a focused search expected to be less prone to falling into local results. Our approach, when tested on SQA decision data, shows promise and compares well to previous approaches to SQA that were using machine learning techniques.","","978-1-4673-2338-3978-1-4673-2336-9978-1-4673-2337","10.1109/NAFIPS.2012.6291044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6291044","","Object oriented modeling;Software quality;Optimization;Measurement;Predictive models;Data mining","decision making;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;software quality","interval-based algorithms;fuzzy measures;software quality assessment;SQA;multicriteria decision making problem;MCDM;Choquet integral;optimization;machine learning","","2","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since there is no guarantee that no more than one fault exists in a faulty program, the approach to locate all the faults is necessary. Spectrum-based fault localization techniques collect dynamic program spectra as well as test results of program runs, and estimate the extent of program elements being related to fault(s). A popular solution into generate a ranked list of suspicious candidates, which are checked in order, stopping whenever a fault is found. Such single fault localizers locate one fault in one checking round, terminate, and wait to be triggered by the regression testing to validate the fixing of the located fault. In this paper, we study the manifestation of multiple faults in a program and propose an effective mechanism to indicate their presence. When a fault is reached during the checking round, we use it to interpret the failures observed, and update the indicator to judge whether there remain other faults in the program. Our indicator serves as a stopping criterion of checking the ranked list of suspicious candidates. Our work factories the multiple fault localization problem into developing single-fault localizers and adapting them to multi-fault programs. It both improves the fault localization efficiencies of single-fault localizers, and avoids the ineffective efforts of thoroughly abandoning the many single-fault localizers to develop multi-fault localizers.","1530-1362;1530-1362;1530-1362","978-1-4673-4930-7978-0-7695-4922","10.1109/APSEC.2012.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462736","fault localization;program spectra;multi-fault","Testing;Software;Debugging;Accuracy;Educational institutions;Computer science;Cognition","software fault tolerance;software quality;software reliability","single-fault localization program;multifault localization program;spectrum-based fault localization technique;dynamic program spectra;program run;regression testing;stopping criterion","","1","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it does not explicitly distinguish the different degree in definiteness between the information associated with the failed spectrum and the passed spectrum, which may result in an unreliable location of faults. Thus in this paper, we propose a refinement method to improve the accuracy of the predication by SBFL, through eliminating the indefinite information. Our method categorizes all statements into two groups according to their different suspiciousness, and then uses different evaluation schemes for these two groups. In this way, we can reduce the use of the unreliable information in the ranking list, and finally provide a more precise result. Experimental study shows that for some SBFL techniques, our method can significantly improve their performance in some situations, and in other cases, it can still remain the techniques' original performance.","2332-662X;1550-6002;1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4978-0-7695-4131","10.1109/QSIC.2010.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562991","program spectrum;fault localization;debugging;risk evaluation","Testing;Measurement;Indexes;Debugging;Software;Proposals;Software reliability","program debugging;program testing;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","spectrum based fault localization;program spectrum;risk evaluation","","9","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Syrlinks (Bruz, FRANCE) has been chosen by CNES for developing and manufacturing this equipment which should be tested on board the scientific microsatellite named MICROSCOPE that will be launched in 2015. The GNSS receiver under development is a highperformance equipment specially designed and optimized for the needs and constraints of small platforms for which small volume, low mass and low power consumption are important parameters. This equipment is based on COTS (Commercials Off The Shelf) in order to exploit the performance of the advanced technology developed for terrestrial applications and to reduce significantly the global cost of the equipment. The structure of this GNSS receiver is organized around a reconfigurable architecture with the use of one FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) associated with one DSP (Digital Signal Processor). The GNSS function is then split in two main parts according to the real time requirements of the processing and navigation operations. The hardware (HW) architecture has been optimized to be able to support a low power mode through a fractioned activity that has been implemented by introducing standby time frames during the mission. An orbital extrapolator is also implemented for propagating position and velocity without pseudo range measurements. This receiver is able to process GPS (L1) and GALILEO (E1) signals simultaneously in the first version of the software and will be able to evolve in a second step to a dual frequency mode, compatible with E5a/E1, or with E5b/E1.

Practitioners have utilized those unconventional algorithms for the past few decades.

In such complex system within the environment consisting of wide range of non-interactive as well as interactive applications and services for television, internet, gamming, healthcare, surveillance, etc., efficient and reliable DTV functional verification becomes highly necessary and challenging task. Since efficient DTV testing is considered as one of the most important issues for the reduced time-to-market, its optimization is of crucial importance to the DTV manufacturing process. Having in mind the end-users as the main target of the DTV, optimal test generation process must also include estimated usage-profiles in addition to the pre-defined DTV designed specification. This is especially important considering new emerging multimedia technologies for DTV which are not yet fully standardized and evaluated, and which exact employment (from the point of end-users) is not known in advance. In this paper we propose a novel approach for user driven test-case generation that would enable adequate and efficient testing of the DTV/STB in different development stages before reaching the market, i.e., the end-users. The proposed user driven approach provides optimal test-case generation in terms of both test execution time and adequacy according to the real end-user DTV functional DTV operation and quality of experience (QoE).

The increased vulnerability of the components to atmospheric particle strikes poses a big threat in attaining the reliability required for various mission critical applications. Various soft error mitigation methodologies exist to address this reliability challenge. A general solution to this problem is to arrive at a soft error mitigation methodology with an acceptable implementation overhead and error tolerance level. This implementation overhead can then be reduced by taking advantage of various derating effects like logical derating, electrical derating and timing window derating, and/or making use of application redundancy, e.g. redundancy in firmware/software executing on the so designed robust hardware. In this paper, we analyze the impact of various derating factors and show how they can be profitably employed to reduce the hardware overhead to implement a given level of soft error robustness. This analysis is performed on a set of benchmark circuits using the delayed capture methodology.

Liu","NA; NA; NA","2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","","2010","","","1","4","Smoothing or geometrical optimization is one of basic procedures to improve the quality of mesh. This paper first introduces an error-based mesh quality metric based on the concept of optimal Delaunay triangulations, and then examines the smoothing scheme which minimizes the interpolation error among all triangulations with the same number of vertices. Facing to its deficiency, a modified smoothing scheme and corresponding optimization model for tetrahedral mesh that avoid illegal elements are proposed. The optimization model is solved by integrating chaos search and BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm efficiently. Quality improvement for tetrahedral mesh is realized through alternately applying the smoothing approach suggested and topological optimization technique. Testing results show that the proposed approach is effective to improve mesh quality and suitable for combining with topological technique.","","978-1-4244-5391-7978-1-4244-5392","10.1109/CISE.2010.5676713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676713","","Smoothing methods;Optimization;Finite element methods;Algorithm design and analysis;Measurement;Approximation algorithms;Chaos","interpolation;mesh generation;optimisation","smoothing optimization;geometrical optimization;error-based mesh quality metric;Delaunay triangulation;smoothing scheme;chaos search;Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm;topological optimization technique","","","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On multi-core clusters, inter-node network communications are typically an order of magnitude slower than those between processes on the same node, which effectively creates a heterogeneous, tiered network topology. Presently, most MPI implementations assume a homogeneous network composition, which causes them to have less than optimal performance on multi-core clusters. In this paper, we treat a multi-core cluster as a heterogeneous cluster and optimize the performance of MPI broadcast communications by scheduling messages according to topology information. We experimentally demonstrate that previous heuristics for heterogeneous clusters such as Fastest Edge First (FEF) do not produce optimal results on multi-core clusters for broadcast communications. Our solution is to modify the Fastest Edge First heuristic by imposing an additional constraint, that permits only one core per node to participate in inter-node communications, creating a nested binomial tree structure. Using this constraint we are able to achieve performance gains of 20%-60% over the MPI broadcast implementation on homogeneous, multi-core clusters.","","978-1-4673-2164-8978-0-7695-4749","10.1109/HPCC.2012.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332186","Message Passing Interface (MPI);Multicore;Cluster;Broadcast;Fastest Edges First","Network topology;Multicore processing;Clustering algorithms;Topology;Schedules;Benchmark testing;Timing","broadcast communication;computer communications software;message passing;multiprocessing systems;network topology;optimisation;processor scheduling;tree data structures","runtime optimization;dynamic network topology information;modern commodity compute clusters;multicore nodes;multicore clusters;inter-node network communications;heterogeneous network topology;tiered network topology;homogeneous network composition;heterogeneous cluster;performance optimization;MPI broadcast communications;message scheduling;FEF heuristic;fastest edge first heuristic;nested binomial tree structure","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software transactional memory (STM) can run on conventional processors without additional hardware support. In this paper we propose VectorSTM which reduces the cost of centralized concurrency control. VectorSTM employs distributed vector timestamps instead of a single global timestamp to track the progress of transactions. Conflict detecting and transaction committing are done by polling thread local bloom filter queues which are indexed by the vector timestamps. Without employing any atomic instructions, VectorSTM reduces synchronization cost on the global timestamp variable and provides more concurrency. VectorSTM provides privatization safety which is critical to software transactional memory safety and avoids live lock and starvation by effective contention manager. We evaluate VectorSTM with STAMP benchmarks and the results show that the design offer superior performance or stronger semantics than TL2 and RingSTM algorithm. On particular tests VectorSTM outperforms TL2 and RingSTM 27% and 41% respectively with 8 threads running.","","978-1-4244-6813-3978-1-4244-6812","10.1109/CSO.2010.145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533020","multi-core processors;software transactional memory;vector timestamp;atomic instructions","Software safety;Multicore processing;Concurrency control;Concurrent computing;Memory management","concurrency control;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;transaction processing","VectorSTM;software transactional memory;atomic instruction;transactional memory;coordinate concurrent threads;multicore processor;centralized concurrency control;distributed vector timestamp;polling thread local bloom filter queues;synchronization cost;global timestamp variable;software transactional memory safety;contention manager;STAMP benchmark;RingSTM algorithm","","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For such applications, periodic on-line testing of the WSN nodes is an important step towards correctness of operation. However, on-line testing of processors integrated in WSN nodes has to address the additional challenge of minimum energy consumption, because these devices operate on battery, which usually cannot be replaced and in the absence of catastrophic failures determines the lifetime of the system. In this paper initially we derive analytically the optimal way for executing on-line periodic test with adjustable period, taking into account the degrading behavior of the system due to silicon aging effects but also the limited energy budget of WSN applications. The test is applied in the form of Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) routines, thus we proceed to the power optimized development of SBST routines targeting the transition delay fault model that is well suited for detecting timing violations due to silicon aging. Simulation results show that energy savings for the final SBST routine at processor level are up to 35.4% and the impact of test in the battery life of the system is negligible.","1063-6404;1063-6404","978-1-4244-8937-4978-1-4244-8936-7978-1-4244-8935","10.1109/ICCD.2010.5647693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5647693","","Wireless sensor networks;Program processors;Delay;Testing;Circuit faults;Optimization;Weibull distribution","built-in self test;microprocessor chips;wireless sensor networks","energy optimal on-line self-test;microprocessor;WSN nodes;wireless sensor network;environmental hazard;silicon aging effect;wearout effect;software-based self-test;SBST","","","37","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In industrial practice, however, test cases often start out as steps described in natural language. These are essentially directions a human tester needs to follow to interact with an application, exercising a given scenario. Since tests need to be executed repeatedly, such manual tests then have to go through test automation to create scripts or programs out of them. Test automation can be expensive in programmer time. We describe a technique to automate test automation. The input to our technique is a sequence of steps written in natural language, and the output is a sequence of procedure calls with accompanying parameters that can drive the application without human intervention. The technique is based on looking at the natural language test steps as consisting of segments that describe actions on targets, except that there can be ambiguity in identifying segments, in identifying the action in a segment, as well as in the specification of the target of the action. The technique resolves this ambiguity by backtracking, until it can synthesize a successful sequence of calls. We present an evaluation of our technique on professionally created manual test cases for two open-source web applications as well as a proprietary enterprise application. Our technique could automate over 82% of the steps contained in these test cases with no human intervention, indicating that the technique can reduce the cost of test automation quite effectively.","1558-1225;0270-5257;0270-5257","978-1-4673-1067-3978-1-4673-1066-6978-1-4673-1065","10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227131","","Manuals;Automation;Optimization;Humans;Natural languages;Programming profession","natural languages;program testing","automating test automation;test case;natural language;programmer time;human intervention","","19","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among those running programs, some may be important and time-critical, which users would expect them to finish their execution as soon as possible. Generally speaking, the course of program execution includes CPU operation and hard disk operation (disk I/O). For the CPU operation, modern computer systems have the ability to adjust the CPU scheduling sequence according to program priority. However, most computer systems do not have effective ways to conduct disk I/O based on program priority. The Linux operating system has been widely used in many areas. It supports several disk schedulers. The Complete Fair Queuing (CFQ) and the Anticipatory Scheduling (AS) are among those most well-known. Currently, CFQ is the default disk scheduler in the Linux operating system. AS is the predecessor of CFQ. Unfortunately, CFQ only offers prioritized disk I/O to some extent through the tool ""ionice"", while AS does not provide any prioritized service at all. We propose and implement a new disk scheduler, namely Prioritized Anticipatory Scheduling (PAS), by adding schemes of supporting prioritized disk I/O into AS in the Linux kernel. Our experimental results show that PAS surpasses CFQ with ionice for the vast majority of all test cases.

Before a major feature release is made available to customers, it is important to be able to anticipate if the release will be of lesser quality than its predecessor release. Our research group has developed models that use development and test times, resource levels, code added, and bugs found and fixed (or not fixed) to predict whether or not a new feature release will achieve a key quality goal - to be of better quality than its predecessor release. If the release quality prediction models, developed early in the development branches integration phase, indicate a likely upcoming quality problem in the field, another set of predictive models ('playbook' models) are then developed and used by our team to identify development or test practices that are in need of improvement. These playbook models are key components of what we call 'quality playbooks,' that are designed to address several objectives: . Identify 'levers' that positively influence feature release quality. Levers are in-process engineering metrics that are associated with specific development or test processes/practices and measure their adoption and effectiveness. . If possible, identify levers that can be invoked early in the lifecycle, to enable the development and test teams to improve deficient practices and remediate the current release under development. If it is not possible to identify early levers but possible to identify levers later in the lifecycle, we can only change deficient practices to improve the quality of future successor releases. . Determine the potential quality impact of changes suggested by the profile of significant levers. Low impact levers are likely not to be addressed by development teams. . Determine the resource and schedule investments needed to change and implement practices: Training, disruption, additional engineering time, etc. . Using impact and investment calculations identify which practices to change, either for the current release or just for subsequent releases. Develop a prioritization/ROI scheme to provide planning guidance to development and test teams. . Identify specific practice changes needed, or new practices to adopt. . Design and plan pilot programs to test the models, including the impact and investment components. Using this 'playbook' approach, our team has developed models for 31 major feature releases that are resident on 11 different hardware platforms. These models have identified six narrowly-defined classes of metrics that include both actionable levers and 'indicator' metrics that correlate well with release quality. (Indicator metrics do also correlate well, but are less specifically actionable.) The models for these six classes of metrics (and their associated practices) include strong levers and strong indicators for all releases and platforms thus far examined. Impact and investment results are also described in this paper, as are pilot programs that have tested the validity of the modeling and business calculation results. Two additional large-scale pilots of the 'playbook' approach are underway, and these are also described.","","978-1-4673-5048-8978-0-7695-4928","10.1109/ISSREW.2012.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405417","","Predictive models;Investments;Abstracts;Computer bugs;Current measurement;Schedules","economic indicators;investment;prediction theory;quality management;resource allocation;scheduling","quality playbook;predecessor release improvement;resource levels;test times;bugs;key quality goal;quality prediction models;development branches integration phase;predictive models;development identification;test practices;in-process engineering metrics;test processes;test teams;future successor releases quality;potential quality impact;significant lever profile;schedule investments;resource investments;investment calculation identification;prioritization-ROI scheme;investment components;hardware platforms;actionable levers;indicator metrics;business calculation;modeling validity;large-scale pilots","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The trained network is then given as input a set of virtual test cases, each covering a single statement. The output of the network, for each virtual test case, is considered to be the suspiciousness of the corresponding covered statement. A statement with a higher suspiciousness has a higher likelihood of containing a bug, and thus statements can be ranked in descending order of their suspiciousness. The ranking can then be examined one by one, starting from the top, until a bug is located. Case studies on 15 different programs were conducted, and the results clearly show that our proposed technique is more effective than several other popular, state of the art fault localization techniques.

However, the co-verification techniques used for SystemC designs are mostly ad-hoc and non-systematic. A particularly severe drawback is that simulation results have to be evaluated manually. In previous work, we proposed to overcome this problem by conformance testing. We presented an algorithm that uses an abstract SystemC design to compute expected output traces, which are then compared with those of a refined design to evaluate its correctness. The main disadvantage of the algorithm is that it is very expensive because it computes the output traces offline and has to cope with non-deterministic systems. Furthermore, the designer has to compare the results manually with the outputs of a design under test. In this paper, we present an approach for efficient and fully-automatic conformance evaluation of SystemC designs. To achieve this, we first present optimizations of our previously proposed algorithm for the generation of conformance tests that drastically reduce computation time and memory consumption. The main idea is to exploit the specifics of the SystemC semantics to reduce the number of semantic states that have to be kept in memory during state-space exploration. Second, we present an approach to generate SystemC test benches from a set of expected output traces. These test benches allow fully-automatic test execution and conformance evaluation. Together with our previously presented model checking framework for abstract Sys-temC designs, we yield a fully-automatic HW/SW co-verification framework for SystemC that supports the whole design process. We demonstrate the performance and error detecting capability of our approach with experimental results.","1558-1780;1530-1877;1530-1877;1530-1877","978-1-4244-5835-6978-1-4244-5834-9978-1-4244-5832-5978-1-4244-5833","10.1109/ETSYM.2010.5512761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5512761","","Automata;Algorithm design and analysis;System testing;Computational modeling;Embedded system;System-level design;Timing;Switches;Automatic testing;Hardware","conformance testing;hardware-software codesign","automated conformance evaluation;SystemC designs;timed automata;hardware/software co-design;state-space exploration","","2","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This task has non-polynomial complexity and can be posed as a combinatorial optimization problem.

In this paper we present Interval Based Hierarchical Support Vector Machine (IBH-SVM) for identifying optimal power aware combinations of microarchitectural parameters from this exponentially large design space. The advantage of this formulation is twofold in that it accurately and efficiently finds power aware configurations while considerably decreasing the number of software benchmark simulations needed to select the most appropriate configurations. The reduction in power is not only in terms of the savings on future applications run on these processors, but also on the testing time required during the design phase since suboptimal configurations are ignored early on.","2381-0947","978-1-4244-8275-7978-1-4244-8273-3978-1-4244-8274","10.1109/ICEAC.2010.5702317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702317","Hierarchical Support Vector Machine;Microarchitectural Design Space Exploration","Benchmark testing;Microarchitecture;Support vector machines;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Machine learning","benchmark testing;circuit simulation;computer architecture;digital simulation;optimisation;power aware computing;support vector machines","microarchitectural power;SVM;hierarchical support vector machine;benchmark program;power aware configuration;software benchmark simulation;power optimisation;power consumption","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To empirically evaluate these techniques, researchers apply them on subject programs and capture a set of metrics that characterize the techniques' effectiveness. From a user's perspective, the most important metric is often the amount of real time required to find a error (if one exists), but using real time for comparison can be misleading because it is necessarily dependent on the machine configuration used for the experiments. On the other hand, using machine-independent metrics can be meaningless if they do not correlate highly with real time. As a result, it can be difficult to select metrics for valid comparisons among exploration techniques. This paper presents a study of the commonly used machine-independent metrics for two different exploration frameworks for Java (JPF and ReEx) by revisiting and extending a previous study (Parallel Randomized State-Space Search) and evaluating the correlation of the metrics with real time both on a single machine and on a high-performance cluster of machines.

Usually, a heuristic strategy is exploited to use the nearest reconstructed pictures as references. However, such a strategy may not be efficient on all occasions, especially when different content characteristics and coding settings are considered. In this paper, we investigate how to manage reference pictures so as to achieve better rate-distortion performance under the memory constraint of the decoded picture buffer at the decoder. We formulate the reference picture management as an optimization problem and approximate its optimal solution. Moreover, we explore how to adjust quality for each picture according to the reference structure to further improve coding efficiency. For some coding cases, where a complicated encoder optimization is unaffordable, we also develop fast algorithms to get the most benefit from reference picture selection. Among them, one strategy has been adopted by the HEVC software and common test conditions to generate the anchor. Experimental results show that the proposed full search algorithm and fast search algorithms achieve significant bitrate reduction.","1051-8215;1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6324421","High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC);rate-distortion (RD) optimization;reference picture management;reference picture selection","Encoding;Video coding;Optimization;Rate-distortion;Bit rate;Decoding","decoding;image reconstruction;optimisation;rate distortion theory;video coding","rate-distortion optimized reference picture management;high efficiency video coding;motion compensation;multiple reference pictures;HEVC standard;heuristic strategy;rate-distortion performance;decoded picture buffer;decoder;encoder optimization;reference picture selection;HEVC software","","20","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, most research into program phase behavior has focused on the serial SPEC benchmark suite, with little investigations into large scale phase behavior in parallel applications. In this study we compare and examine the time-varying behavior of the SPEC2006 (serial) and the PARSEC 2.1 (parallel) benchmarks suites, and investigate the program phase behavior found in parallel applications with different parallelization models. To this end, we extend a general purpose runtime phase desection library to handle parallel applications. Our results reveal that serial applications have significantly more program phases (2.4x) with larger variation in CPI (1.5x) compared to parallel applications. While the number of phases are fewer in parallel applications, there still exists interesting phase behavior. In particular, we find that data-parallel applications have shorter phases with more threads. This makes phase-guided runtime optimizations (e.g., dynamic voltage frequency scaling) less attractive as the number of threads grows. Meaning it is much more difficult to exploit runtime optimizations in parallel applications.","","978-1-4673-4532-3978-1-4673-4531","10.1109/IISWC.2012.6402900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402900","","Benchmark testing;Runtime;Optimization;Vectors;Libraries;Measurement;Hardware","benchmark testing;optimisation;parallel processing;software libraries;software performance evaluation","parallel applications;serial applications;program phase behavior;serial SPEC benchmark suite;large scale phase behavior;time-varying behavior;SPEC2006 benchmark suite;PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suite;parallelization model;general purpose runtime phase desection library;CPI;data-parallel applications;phase-guided runtime optimization;cycle per instruction","","11","43","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current approaches use specific analytic forms, typically linear, for modeling correlations. In practice, more complex nonlinear relationships exist between metrics. Moreover, most intermetric correlations form clusters rather than simple pairwise correlations. These clusters provide additional information and offer the possibility for optimization. In this paper, we address these issues by using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) as a similarity measure to identify clusters of correlated metrics, without assuming any specific form for the metric relationships. We show how to apply the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test on the entropy measures to detect errors in the system. We also present three diagnosis algorithms to locate faulty components: RatioScore, based on the Jaccard coefficient, SigScore, which incorporates knowledge of component dependencies, and BayesianScore, which uses Bayesian inference to assign a fault probability to each component. We evaluate our approach in the context of a complex enterprise application, and show that 1) stable, nonlinear correlations exist and can be captured with our approach; 2) we can detect a large fraction of faults with a low false positive rate (we detect up to 18 of the 22 faults we injected); and 3) we improve the diagnosis with our new diagnosis algorithms.","1545-5971;1941-0018;2160-9209","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714701","Self-managing systems;fault detection;fault diagnosis;information theory;mutual information;autonomic systems.","Measurement;Entropy;Monitoring;Correlation;Random variables;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","entropy;fault location;fault tolerant computing;program testing;software metrics","fault detection;fault diagnosis;complex software system;information-theoretic monitoring;management metrics;intermetric correlation;normalized mutual information;similarity measure;Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test;entropy measure;faulty component;RatioScore;Jaccard coefficient;SigScore;omponent dependency;BayesianScore;Bayesian inference;fault probability;complex enterprise application;diagnosis algorithm","","13","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Static Execute After (SEA) is a relation on program elements (procedures) that is efficiently computable and accurate enough to be a candidate for use in impact analysis in practice. To assess the applicability of SEA in terms of capturing real defects, we present results on integrating it into the build system of Web Kit, a large, open source software system, and on related experiments. We show that a large number of real defects can be captured by impact sets computed by SEA, albeit many of them are large. We demonstrate that this is not an issue in applying it to regression test prioritization, but generally it can be an obstacle in the path to efficient use of impact analysis. We believe that the main reason for large impact sets is the formation of dependence clusters in code.

The framework translates the binary into assembly code and tracks the data flow. Then with static method, the system can get the important information which can't be gained at runtime, such as unexecuted part of the code.

So a modified client clock is constructed to improve the accuracy of the clock. For this premise, the technique of Data Packet Selection is proposed, which is a method to determine whether to transfer by comparing the queue length of the router table with a specified value in the packet. By using this technique, the client clock precision can be raised to microsecond level, which can meet the time synchronization needs of NTP. Meanwhile, the optimized NTP time synchronization algorithm can also significantly reduce the errors that caused by the network delay.

The passive congregation is a biological behavior which allows the swarm to preserve its integrity, balancing between global and local search.

We explore and analyze several optimization opportunities to adapt STM parameters to a running program. This paper uses adaptSTM, a flexible STM library with a non-adaptive baseline common to current fast STM libraries to evaluate different performance options. The baseline is extended by an online evaluation system that enables the measurement of key runtime parameters like read- and write-locations, or commit- and abort-rate. The performance data is used by a thread-local adaptation system to tune the STM configuration. The system adapts different important parameters like write-set hash-size, hash-function, and write strategy based on runtime statistics on a per-thread basis. We discuss different self-adapting parameters, especially their performance implications and the resulting trade-offs. Measurements show that local per-thread adaptation outperforms global system-wide adaptation. We position local adaptivity as an extension to existing systems. Using the STAMP benchmarks, we compare adaptSTM to two other STM libraries, TL2 and tinySTM. Comparing adaptSTM and the adaptation system to TL2 results in an average speedup of 43% for 8 threads and 137% for 16 threads. adaptSTM offers performance that is competitive with tinySTM for low-contention benchmarks; for high-contention benchmarks adaptSTM outperforms tinySTM. Thread-local adaptation alone increases performance on average by 4.3% for 16 threads, and up to 10% for individual benchmarks, compared to adaptSTM without active adaptation.","","978-1-61284-368-1978-1-61284-367","10.1109/ISPASS.2011.5762733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762733","","Benchmark testing;Adaptive systems;Optimization;Libraries;Runtime;Synchronization;Bioinformatics","concurrency control;multi-threading;software performance evaluation;transaction processing","performance evaluation;software transactional memory;STM library;thread-local adaptation system;write-set hash-size;hash-function;write strategy;STAMP benchmarks;daptSTM","","1","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Etching parameters are evaluated in order to optimize the isotropic etching process. For optimization purpose, Design of Experiment (DOE) with full factorial design is employed. Etching factors namely the bubbling flow rate, wafer rotation, and etchant temperature are randomised with additional three centre points to observe any curvature. The responses studied are etching removal, total thickness variation (TTV) and wafer brightness. It is found that etchant temperature gives major impact on all three responses stated above. The etchant temperature is the main effect factor and significantly affects TTV. Additionally, the etchant temperature and bubbling flow rate provide interaction effects on both the etching removal and wafer brightness. A higher bubbling flow rate is required to ensure etching removal and brightness within specification. Besides studying these three responses, the wafer surface after etching is additionally analysed using ADE Infotool software which captures the etched profile and its thickness. The ADE result indicates that a higher temperature contributes to a more concave shape of etched wafer, thus resulting in higher TTV and sending the wafers out of specification. Finally, the optimum condition is tested on a final run. The removal uniformity is observed in removal distribution graphs. The etching performance is enhanced with the optimized value of bubbling flow rate, etchant temperature and wafer rotation to achieve the best removal distribution.","1089-8190;1089-8190","978-1-4244-8827-8978-1-4244-8825-4978-1-4244-8826","10.1109/IEMT.2010.5746677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746677","Design of Experiment;isotropic etching;silicon wafer","Temperature distribution;Brightness;Response surface methodology;Etching;Rotation measurement","design of experiments;etching;optimisation;wafer level packaging","optimization;isotropic etching;silicon wafers;chemical reactions;design of experiment;bubbling flow rate;wafer rotation;etchant temperature;etching removal;total thickness variation;wafer brightness;ADE Infotool software;removal distribution graphs","","","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a wide variety of sequence representations exist, lack of a generic implementation of efficient sequence storage has led to a plethora of poorly reusable or programming language- specific implementations. We present a novel, space-efficient data structure (GtEncseq) for storing multiple biological sequences of variable alphabet size, with customizable character transformations, wildcard support, and an assortment of internal representations optimized for different distributions of wildcards and sequence lengths. For the human genome (3.1 gigabases, including 237 million wildcard characters) our representation requires only 2 + 8 Â· 10<sup>-6</sup>bits per character. Implemented in C, our portable software implementation provides a variety of methods for random and sequential access to characters and substrings (including different reading directions) using an object-oriented interface. In addition, it includes access to metadata like sequence descriptions or character distributions. The library is extensible to be used from various scripting languages. GtEncseq is much more versatile than previous solutions, adding features that were previously unavailable.

The thread pool pattern uses pools of pre-existing and reusable threads to limit thread lifecycle over-head (thread creation and destruction) and resource thrashing (thread proliferation). However, these advantages are weighed against performance issues caused by concurrency risks, like synchronization errors or deadlock, and thread pool-specific risks, like poorly tuned pool size or thread leakage. Detecting these performance issues during load testing requires a thorough understanding of how thread pools behave, yet most performance analysts have limited knowledge of the system and are flooded with terabytes of data from load tests. We propose a methodology to identify threads with performance deviations in thread pools. Our methodology ranks threads based on the dissimilarity of their resource usage metrics. A case study on a large-scale industrial software system shows that our methodology can identify threads with performance deviations with an average precision of 100% and an average recall of 76.61%. Our methodology performs very well when ranking long-lived deviations, such as memory leaks, but more work is needed to rank short-lived deviations, such as CPU spikes.","1063-6773;1063-6773","978-1-4577-0664-6978-1-4577-0663-9978-1-4577-0662","10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080775","thread-pools;behaviour-based clustering;understanding ULS systems","Instruction sets;Covariance matrix;Queueing analysis;Synchronization;Educational institutions","electronic commerce;multi-threading;object-oriented methods;pattern clustering;resource allocation;synchronisation","identifying performance deviation;large-scale software system;distributed design pattern;thread pool pattern;thread lifecycle overhead;resource thrashing;concurrency risk;synchronization errors;thread pool-specific risk;thread leakage;performance deviation;large-scale industrial software system","","8","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research involves the application of an iterative development methodology to refine creative computer-based techniques for the exploration and navigation of multi-dimensional aural and visual content operating within three-dimensional Cartesian space. Various computational functions for utilising a web browser-based system, oriented around a conceptual n-tier layer model, are being developed and refined. Visualisation computational processes related to images (still and moving) of the same place (such as a building) or other artefact (such as a map) over time utilise both authentic and synthetic content.

Starting from a set of preexisting test workloads, BURN finds a policy that interleaves their execution to stress the multitier application and generate controlled burstiness in resource consumption. This is useful to study, in a controlled way, the robustness of software services to sudden changes in the workload characteristics and in the usage levels of the resources. The problem is tackled by a model-based technique which first generates Markov models to describe resource consumption patterns of each test workload. Then, a policy is generated using an optimization program which sets as constraints a target request mix and user-specified levels of burstiness at the different resources in the system. Burstiness is quantified using a novel metric called overdemand, which describes in a natural way the tendency of a workload to keep a resource congested for long periods of time and across multiple requests. A case study based on a three-tier application testbed shows that our method is able to control and predict burstiness for session service demands at a fine-grained scale. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that for any given request mix our approach can expose latency and throughput degradations not found with nonbursty workloads having the same request mix.","0098-5589;1939-3520;2326-3881","","10.1109/TSE.2011.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928353","Benchmarking;performance;burstiness;bottleneck migration;overdemand","Benchmark testing;Markov processes;Servers;Aggregates;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Linear regression","benchmark testing;Markov processes","BURN;workload burstiness;customized service benchmarks;customized benchmarks;multitier application;time-varying resource usage condition;controlled burstiness;software services;model-based technique;Markov models;resource consumption pattern;optimization program;target request mix;user-specified levels;three-tier application testbed;session service demands;fine-grained scale;latency;throughput degradation;nonbursty workloads","","8","38","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

State of the art solutions for the optimization of these dynamic structures operate with code written in C++ or higher level languages. This work presents an automatic framework for the dynamic data structure optimization of applications written in C. The major advantages of this framework are the rich set of ready-to-use data structures in C that a developer can use to focus on the application itself and the fact that it targets applications in C rather than a higher level language. Moreover, the communication with existing state of the art optimization mechanisms in C++ provides the flexibility in optimization and the customization in the final solutions, needed for modern applications from many domains. The real world applicability of the proposed framework is proved by integrating it with well-known benchmarks written in C.

This paper describes a novel technique for automating such optimizations, applied to barrier operations. Portability poses a challenge when optimizing for locality, as costs are bound to variations in platform topology. This challenge is addressed through representing both platform structure and barrier algorithms as input data, and altering the algorithm based on benchmark results which can be easily obtained from a given platform. Our resulting optimization technique is empirically tested on two modern clusters, up to eight dual quad-core nodes on one, and up to ten dual hex-core nodes on another. Included test results show that the method captures performance advantages on both systems without any explicit customization, and produces specialized barriers of superior performance to a topology-neutral implementation.","1530-2075;1530-2075","978-1-61284-425-1978-0-7695-4577","10.1109/IPDPS.2011.124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6008818","","Topology;Clustering algorithms;Optimization;Benchmark testing;Software;Prediction algorithms;Synchronization","application program interfaces;message passing;optimisation","heterogeneous systems;MPI;clustered SMP systems;barrier operations;platform structure;barrier algorithms;optimization technique;dual hex-core nodes;topology-neutral implementation;platform topology;parallel architectures","","2","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since a multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) is able to obtain an approximation to the Pareto optimal set and provide substantial information of the tradeoff between objectives, it is becoming one of the most successful methods for multi-objective optimization. Usually, an MOEA generates new trial solutions (offspring) with some candidate decision vectors (parents) to search for the promising areas and make the population evolve towards the Pareto optimal set. Moreover, in the reproduction procedure, most of MOEAs view the decision vector as a whole, and do not recognize the effects of a single component on the new trial solutions. In this paper, we propose the component-emphasizing mechanism for enhancing the search ability of MOEAs. In this mechanism, each component of a decision vector is viewed as an independent factor affecting the quality of the solution. Based on the mechanism, a new MOEA is presented. Finally, the performance of this new algorithm is compared with two other promising MOEAs, namely, NSGA-II and GDE3, on a set of test instances. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others in solution quality and time cost.","","978-1-4244-6440-1978-1-4244-6437-1978-1-4244-6439","10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645288","MOEA;elite population;steady-state strategy;component-emphasizing mechanism","Artificial neural networks","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","component-emphasizing mechanism;multiobjective optimization;industrial design;scientific research;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;Pareto optimal set;trial solutions;decision vector;search ability;NSGA-II;GDE3","","","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards this, in this paper, we i) construct a branch penalty model for compiler, ii) formulate the problem of minimizing branch penalty using branch hinting and iii) propose a heuristic to solve this problem. The heuristic is based on three basic techniques that we introduce in this paper: NOP padding, hint pipelining, and nested loop restructuring. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our solution can reduce the branch penalty as much as 35.4% over the previous approach.","","978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0712","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062308","Branch hint;Cell processor;Compiler optimization","Computer architecture;Software;Pipeline processing;Hardware;Microprocessors;Pipelines;Benchmark testing","multiprocessing systems;pipeline processing;program compilers","branch penalty reduction;IBM cell SPU;software branch hinting;processor design;hardware branch prediction;synergistic processing unit;IBM cell processor;branch hint instructions;branch probability;branch penalty model;compiler;NOP padding;hint pipelining;nested loop restructuring","","","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a hardware implementation of a parallel self-adaptive PSO algorithm based on an attractive-repulsive scheme and using the efficient floating-point arithmetic which performs computations with large dynamic range and high precision. The parallel capabilities of the PSO are exploited by implementing parallel particles directly in hardware in order to decrease the running time. In addition, the attractive-repulsive technique avoids the premature convergence problem by self-adapting the swarm behavior according to its diversity.

However, when maximizing the throughput of 3D MCP, due to the inherent heat removal limitation, thermal issues must be taken into consideration. Furthermore, since the temperature of a core strongly depends on its location in the 3D MCP, a proper task allocation helps to alleviate any potential thermal problem and improve the throughput. In this paper, we present a thermal-aware on-line task allocation algorithm for 3D MCPs. The results of our experiments show that our proposed method achieves 16.32X runtime speedup, and 23.18% throughput improvement. These are comparable to the exhaustive solutions obtained from optimization modeling software LINGO. On average, our throughput is only 0.85% worse than that of the exhaustive method.

Some applications make use of different modalities for both input and output, which adds great complexity to such systems. Due to a possible high number of input modalities and devices available, the task of combining all the information conveyed by users from these sources, becomes critical and troublesome. This process is commonly referred to, as multi modal fusion, and is performed by fusion engines, components of multi modal systems, that have the purpose of receiving multiple streams of input, combine them, and reaching an interpretation of user intent. Evaluating the efficiency of this process is a task that requires a considerate amount of effort, due to all the variables involved. In this paper we present an evaluation framework and methodology aimed towards the assessment and optimization of fusion engines performance. We begin by correlating our work to project GUIDE, explaining how fusion is achieved and how information about user and context are used for adaptation.

Finding a good workflow mapping scheme critically depends on an accurate prediction of the execution time of each individual computational module in the workflow. The time prediction of a scientific computation does not have a silver bullet as it is determined collectively by several dynamic system factors including concurrent loads, memory size, CPU speed, and also by the complexity of the computational program itself. This paper investigates the problem of modeling scientific computations and predicting their execution time based on a combination of both hardware and software properties. We employ statistical learning techniques to estimate the effective computational power of a given computer node at any point of time and estimate the total number of CPU cycles needed for executing a given computational program on any input data size. We analytically derive an upper bound of the estimation error for execution time prediction given the hardware and software properties. The proposed statistical analysis-based solution to performance modeling and prediction is validated and justified by experimental results measured on the computing nodes that vary significantly in terms of the hardware specifications.","2378-3818","978-1-4577-0879-4978-0-7695-4461","10.1109/SERVICES.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012708","Performance modeling;scientific computation;regression techniques","Hardware;Software;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Estimation;Benchmark testing;Complexity theory","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;optimisation;scientific information systems;statistical analysis;workflow management software","performance modeling;scientific workflow optimization;computer node;workflow mapping scheme;CPU speed;memory size;computational program complexity;statistical learning technique","","7","37","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas the former requires knowledge about the syntax and static semantics of the programming language, the latter requires some least understanding of its dynamic semantics, i.e., how expressions are evaluated. We present an approach that is knowledgeable enough to generate only mutants that are both syntactically and semantically correct and likely exhibit non-equivalent behaviour. Our approach builds on our own prior work on constraint-based refactoring tools, and works by negating behaviour-preserving constraints. As a proof of concept we present an enhanced implementation of the Access Modifier Change operator for Java programs whose naive implementations create huge numbers of mutants that do not compile or leave behaviour unaltered. While we cannot guarantee that our generated mutants are non-equivalent, we can demonstrate a considerable reduction in the number of vain mutant generations, leading to substantial temporal savings.","1558-1225;0270-5257","978-1-60558-719","10.1145/1806799.1806862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062110","accessibility;constraints;mutation analysis;object-oriented programming;refactoring;testing","Semantics;Java;Syntactics;Testing;Optimization;Program processors;Programming","constraint handling;Java;programming language semantics;software maintenance;software tools","behaviour preservation;behaviour modification;constraint-based mutant generation;mutation analysis;program mutation;static programming language semantics;dynamic semantics;constraint-based refactoring tools;access modifier change operator;Java programs","","3","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Analysis and Optimization of Data Import with Hadoop","W. Xu; W. Luo; N. Woodward","NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops & PhD Forum","","2012","","","1058","1066","Data driven research has become an important part of scientific discovery in an increasing number of disciplines. In many cases, the sheer volume of data to be processed requires not only state-of-the-art computing resources but also carefully tuned and specifically developed software. These requirements are often associated with huge operational costs and significant expertise in software development. Due to its simplicity for the user and effectiveness at processing big data, Hadoop has become a popular software platform for large-scale data analysis. Using a Hadoop cluster in a remote shared infrastructure enables users to avoid the costs of maintaining a physical infrastructure. An inevitable step in using dynamically constructed Hadoop cluster is the initial importing of the data. This process is not trivial, particularly when the size of the data is large. In this paper, we evaluate the costs of importing large-scale data into a Hadoop cluster. We present a detailed analysis of the default data importing implementation in Hadoop and conduct a practical evaluation. Our evaluation includes tests with different hardware configurations, such as different network protocol and disk configurations. We also propose an implementation to improve the performance of importing data into a Hadoop cluster wherein the data is accessed directly by Data nodes during the import process.","","978-1-4673-0974","10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270755","cloud computing;data import;disk I/O;data transfter;Hadoop","Pipelines;Sockets;Data models;File systems;Throughput;Hardware;Computational modeling","data analysis;optimisation;software engineering","optimization;data import;data driven research;scientific discovery;state-of-the-art computing resources;software development;software platform;large-scale data analysis;Hadoop cluster","","4","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Predicting the behaviors of deformation during a forming process is one of the main challenges in cold forming. Instead of the traditional method called trial and error process, numerical simulation based on finite element analysis method could be used to achieve a better understanding of forming deformation during the process and to predict tools for several failure modes to reduce the number of costly experimental verification tests. In this paper, optimization of forming process for transiting part of combustion chamber is mainly performed by ABAQUS software. The numerical simulation model was constructed by CAD software. This part structure is very complex and the defects such as wrinkles and springback occur during forming. The present research work is aimed at avoiding the wrinkles. Using numerical simulation technology, the influences of friction coefficient and blankholder force in wrinkle have been investigated and optimized values for these two important process parameters are suggested in order to eliminate wrinkles.

Fragola","Valador, Inc., 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 300 Herndon VA 20170 USA; Valador, Inc., 265 Sunrise Highway, Suite 22, Rockville Centre, New York 11570 USA","2011 Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium","","2011","","","1","7","The efficient development of a highly reliable system, such as a new crew launch vehicle, cannot afford to ignore the lessons of history. A number of interesting studies of launch vehicle failures provide very valuable, albeit qualitative âlessons learnedâ on measures that a risk-informed program should take. If schedule and funds were unlimited, a very intensive and exhaustive test program would be the course to follow before the first flight of a new launcher. But when a program is faced with stringent schedule and cost constraints, it needs to optimize its test planning so as to meet constraints without sacrificing safety. Making such trade-offs intelligently requires having a way to quantify the relationship between the initial unreliability of a system, and the array of risk-mitigating measures on hand. This paper proposes several analysis steps beyond the existing studies of historical launch vehicle failures, which can form the basis for quantifying the lessons of history. Firstly, risk cannot be quantified accurately by summing all failures across history, because systems were not exposed to the same design deficiencies at each flight. Early failures typically represent sources of high risk, which are eliminated by corrective actions after the early flights, while late failures are often indicative of low-risk, design deficiencies that remain present for many flights. Thus failures occurring in the early launches of a system actually represent more risk than failures occurring later in history. Quantifying historical risk properly requires taking into account the reality of reliability growth. Secondly, knowing what failed in the past does not provide direct guidance as to how to reduce the risk of a new design. Of utmost relevance are the kinds of measures that could have prevented the failures in the first place. Simplistically put, knowing that the majority of launch vehicle failures originated in propulsion systems is of limited use to designers and managers, who already pay tremendous attention to that central subsystem. By contrast, a quantification of the potential risk reduction possible by submitting an engine to stress testing, for example, could be valuable in supporting the cost and schedule trade-offs that decision makers are unavoidably faced with. This paper proposes a method for re-considering the failures of historical launchers in that new light and illustrates its application to two historical examples, the Ariane and Centaur systems. The results provide an approximate quantification of the risk reduction potentially offered by improvements in areas such as: sufficient flight-like testing at the system level; definition of, and testing for, margins that consider all phases of flight, including not only steady-state but also transient conditions; stress testing and testing for variability at the component and engine levels; analysis of the results of every single flight with an eye towards uncovering design defects: âpost-success investigationsâ re-examination of the margins of all components and systems (including software) and re-qualification after every single change in design, configuration, or mission profile; and maintenance of very rigorous levels of electrical and cabling parts control, quality assurance and contamination control in all phases of manufacturing, assembly and launch operations. The authors hope that the techniques and insights presented in this paper can be of use to the aerospace industry as it embarks on the flight certification program for the next-generation crewed launcher.","0149-144X;0149-144X","978-1-4244-8856-8978-1-4244-8857-5978-1-4244-8855","10.1109/RAMS.2011.5754436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5754436","launch vehicle;reliability;growth;test;risk mitigation;analysis","Testing;Engines;Reliability;History;Vehicles;Modeling;Stress","aerospace industry;failure analysis;maintenance engineering;propulsion;quality assurance;testing;vehicles","risk mitigation measure;crew launch vehicle;risk-informed program;intensive test program;exhaustive test program;test planning;launch vehicle failure;propulsion system;risk reduction;stress testing;flight-like testing;mission profile;maintenance;quality assurance;contamination control;aerospace industry;flight certification program;next generation crewed launcher","","2","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"BlockChop: Dynamic squash elimination for hybrid processor architecture","J. Mars; N. Kumar","University of Virginia, USA; Intel Corporation, USA","2012 39th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)","","2012","","","536","547","Hybrid processors are HW/SW co-designed processors that leverage blocked-execution, the execution of regions of instructions as atomic blocks, to facilitate aggressive speculative optimization. As we move to a multicore hybrid design, fine grained conflicts for shared data can violate the atomicity requirement of these blocks and lead to expensive squashes and rollbacks. However, as these atomic regions differ from those used in checkpointing and transactional memory systems, the extent of this potentially prohibitive problem remains unclear, and mechanisms to mitigate these squashes dynamically may be critical to enable a highly performant multicore hybrid design. In this work, we investigate how multithreaded applications, both benchmark and commercial workloads, are affected by squashes, and present dynamic mechanisms for mitigating these squashes in hybrid processors. While the current wisdom is that there is not a significant number of squashes for smaller atomic regions, we observe this is not the case for many multithreaded workloads. With region sizes of just 200 - 500 instructions, we observe a performance degradation ranging from 10% to more than 50% for workloads with a mixture of shared reads and writes. By harnessing the unique flexibility provided by the software subsystem of hybrid processor design, we present BlockChop, a framework for dynamically mitigating squashes on multicore hybrid processors. We present a range of squash handling mechanisms leveraging retrials, interpretation, and retranslation, and find that BlockChop is quite effective. Over the current response to exceptions and squashes in a hybrid design, we are able to improve the performance of benchmark and commercial workloads by 1.4x and 1.2x on average for large and small region sizes respectively.","1063-6897;1063-6897;1063-6897","978-1-4673-0476-4978-1-4673-0475-7978-1-4673-0473-3978-1-4673-0474","10.1109/ISCA.2012.6237046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6237046","","Multicore processing;Hardware;Registers;Optimization;Software;Benchmark testing","checkpointing;concurrency control;hardware-software codesign;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;optimisation","BlockChop;dynamic squash elimination;hybrid processor architecture;HW/SW co-designed processors;atomic blocks;aggressive speculative optimization;multicore hybrid design;checkpointing;transactional memory systems;multithreaded applications;performance degradation;software subsystem;squash handling mechanisms","","","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PSO has been proved to be successful in many applications in continuous optimization problems. In this paper, we show that PSO is capable of software pipelining loops by overlapping placement, scheduling and routing of successive loop iterations and executing them in parallel. Our proposed algorithm has been experimentally validated on various DSP benchmarks under two different architecture configurations. These experiments indicate that the proposed MCHPSO algorithm can find schedules with small initiation intervals within a reasonable amount of time. PSO is thus a promising alternative for obtaining near optimal solutions to this NP-hard scheduling problem.","","978-1-4244-7896-5978-1-4244-7897-2978-1-4244-7895","10.1109/SOCPAR.2010.5685969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685969","Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures;Particle Swarm Optimization;Modulo Scheduling;Loop level parallelism;Mapping","Schedules;Routing;Benchmark testing;Scheduling algorithm;Computer architecture;Scheduling","computational complexity;parallel architectures;particle swarm optimisation;pipeline processing;program control structures;reconfigurable architectures;scheduling","coarse grained reconfigurable architecture;modulo constrained hybrid particle swarm optimization;loop level parallelism;software pipelining loop;successive loop iteration routing;DSP;NP hard scheduling","","3","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While hardware accelerators often are stateless, network processing exemplifies the need for stateful hardware acceleration. The packet oriented streaming nature of current networks enables data processing as soon as packets arrive rather than when the data of the whole network flow is available. Due to the concurrence of many flows, an accelerator must maintain and switch contexts between many states of the various accelerated streams embodied in the flows, which increases overhead associated with acceleration. We propose and evaluate dynamic reordering of requests of different accelerated streams in a hybrid on-chip/memory based request queue in order to reduce the associated overhead.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-8-6978-1-61284-208-0978-3-9810801-7","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763285","","Acceleration;Context;Throughput;Time factors;System-on-a-chip;Hardware;Switches","computer architecture;general purpose computers;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;optimisation","optimization;stateful hardware acceleration;hybrid architectures;power consumption;general-purpose micro-processors cores;network processing;packet oriented streaming nature;data processing;dynamic reordering","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With increase in memory size, memory repair becomes necessary to improve yield. Memory repair consists of complex offline analysis requiring (i) fault diagnosis and (ii) optimizing reconfiguration based on failure map and available spare resources. This paper presents an embedded repair scheme that uses resources within a MPSoC. The main challenge involves establishing integrity of such internal resources before they are used for repair. We propose a layered approach to testing that (i) tests local processor cache first and uses (ii) software based self-testing of limited processor functions using (iii) a small program loaded into a cache from tester, which then (iv) serves as a vehicle for memory repair. This repaired memory can store and run larger software-based self-test programs to test the remaining systems. Software simulation is used to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed DFT scheme and test methodology. The main advantages of this approach are (i) avoidance of memory testers that are typically necessary for memory repair, (ii) avoiding additional hardware to support repair by using existing resources and (iii) testing all components using a logic tester.","2159-3477;2159-3469;2159-3469","978-1-4673-2234-8978-0-7695-4767","10.1109/ISVLSI.2012.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296457","","Maintenance engineering;Redundancy;Hardware;Software;Built-in self-test;Computer aided manufacturing","memory architecture;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","DFT methodology;embedded memory;MPSoC;memory built-in self-test;multiprocessor system on chip;memory size;memory repair;complex offline analysis;fault diagnosis;reconfiguration;failure map;available spare resource;embedded repair;local processor cache;software based self-testing;limited processor function;software based self-test program;software simulation;memory tester;logic tester","","1","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The error detectors take the form of checking expressions and are optimized for each control-flow path followed at runtime. The derived detectors are implemented using a combination of hardware and software and continuously monitor the application at runtime. If an error is detected at runtime, the application is stopped so as to prevent error propagation and enable a clean recovery.

It must have high performance to enable fetching of instructions on every cycle. However, current designs waste a large amount of energy on each access as tags and data banks from all cache ways are consulted in parallel to fetch the correct instructions as quickly as possible. Existing approaches to reduce this overhead remove unnecessary accesses to the data banks or to the ways that are not likely to hit. However, tag hunks still need to be checked. This paper considers a new hybrid hardware and linker-assisted approach to tagless instruction caching. Our novel cache architecture, supported by the compilation toolchain, removes the need for tag checks entirely for the majority of cache accesses. The linker places frequently-executed instructions in specific program regions that are then mapped into the cache without the need for tag checks. This requires minor hardware modifications, no ISA changes and works across cache configurations. Our approach keeps the software and hardware independent, resulting in both backward and forward compatibility. evaluation on a superscalar processor with and without SMI' support shows power savings of 66% within the instruction cache with no loss of performance. This translates to a 49% saving when considering the combined power of the instruction cache and translation lookaside buffer, which is involved in managing our tagless scheme.","","978-1-61284-357-5978-1-61284-356-8978-1-61284-358","10.1109/CGO.2011.5764672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764672","","Program processors;Hardware;Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Arrays;Logic gates;Aerospace electronics","cache storage;microprocessor chips;multi-threading;optimisation;power aware computing","microprocessor;tagless instruction caching;power efficiency;link time optimization;data banks;tag banks;compilation toolchain;superscalar processor;SMT;translation lookaside buffer;hybrid hardware-linker assisted approach","","2","38","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Engineering these largescaled systems efficiently requires making decisions about a number of issues. In addition, customers expectations imply continuous software delivery in predictable quality. The operation such systems demands for transparency of the software in regard to lifecycle, change and incident management as well as cost efficiency. Addressing these challenges, we learned how to benefit from traditional industries. Contrary to the fact that the IT business calls itself gladly an industry, the industrialization of software engineering in most cases moves on a rather modest level. Industrialization means not only to build a solution or product on top of managed and well-defined processes, but also to have access to structured information about the current conditions of manufacturing at any time. Comparably with test series and assembly lines of the automobile industry, each individual component and each step from the beginning of manufacturing up to the final product should be equipped with measuring points for quality and progress. Even one step further the product itself, after it has left the factory, should be able to continuously provide analytic data for diagnostic reasons. Information is automatically collected and builds the basic essentials for process control, optimization and continuous improvement of the software engineering process. This presentation shows by means of a practical experience report how AdNovum managed to build its software engineering based on a well-balanced system of processes, continuous measurement and control â as well as a healthy portion of pragmatism.

System-level fault diagnosis is concerned with the detection of all faulty nodes in a set of interconnected units. This is accomplished by thoroughly examining the collection of outcomes of all tests carried out by the nodes under a particular test model. Such task has non-polynomial complexity and can be posed as a combinatorial optimization problem, whose optimal solution has been sought through bio-inspired methods like genetic algorithms, ant colonies and artificial immune systems. In this paper, we employ a swarm of artificial fireflies to quickly and reliably navigate across the search space of all feasible sets of faulty units under the invalidation and comparison test models. Our approach uses a binary encoding of the potential solutions (fireflies), an adaptive light absorption coefficient to accelerate the search and problem-specific knowledge to handle infeasible solutions.

We focus on the case of BlobSeer, a large-scale distributed system for storing massive data. The paper explains why and how to enhance BlobSeer with introspective capabilities and proposes a three-layered architecture relying on the MonALISA monitoring framework. This approach has been evaluated on the Grid'5000 testbed, with experiments that prove the feasibility of generating relevant information related to the state and the behavior of the system.","","978-1-4244-5918-6978-1-4244-5917-9978-0-7695-3967","10.1109/CISIS.2010.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447468","Distributed system;storage management;large-scale system;monitoring;introspection","Large-scale systems;Computer science;Competitive intelligence;Software performance;Software systems;Computerized monitoring;Application software;System testing;Mesh generation;State feedback","distributed databases;grid computing;information retrieval systems;monitoring;optimisation;resource allocation","blobseer data management system;MonALISA distributed monitoring framework;resource-usage optimization;distributed systems;monitoring system;introspection layer;massive data storage","","3","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some object-oriented languages allow the programmers to express queries explicitly in the code, which are optimized using the query optimization techniques from the database domain. In this regard, Java Query Language has been developed that allows object querying and performs the query optimization at run-time. Therefore, only one problem is how to reduce the task of query optimization at run-time as much as possible within the Java Query Language system. In this paper, we have developed a technique that performs query optimization at compile-time to reduce the burden of optimization at run-time to improve the performance of the code execution. The proposed approach uses histograms that are computed from the data and these histograms are used to get the estimate of selectivity for query joins and predicates in a query at compile-time. With these estimates, a query plan is constructed at compile-time and executed it at run-time. The experimental trials show that our method performs better in terms of run time comparisons than the existing query optimization techniques used in the Java Query Language.","0730-3157;0730-3157;0730-3157","978-1-4244-7513-1978-1-4244-7512-4978-0-7695-4085","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676286","selectivity;joins;compile time;run-time;histograms;query optimization","Histograms;Query processing;Java;Database languages;Benchmark testing;Frequency estimation","object-oriented programming;query languages","query optimization;programming codes;run time execution;object oriented languages;object querying;Java Query Language system","","2","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Divergence Analysis and Optimizations","B. Coutinho; D. Sampaio; F. M. Q. Pereira; W. Meira Jr.","NA; NA; NA; NA","2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","","2011","","","320","329","The growing interest in GPU programming has brought renewed attention to the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) execution model. SIMD machines give application developers a tremendous computational power, however, the model also brings restrictions. In particular, processing elements (PEs) execute in lock-step, and may lose performance due to divergences caused by conditional branches. In face of divergences, some PEs execute, while others wait, this alternation ending when they reach a synchronization point. In this paper we introduce divergence analysis, a static analysis that determines which program variables will have the same values for every PE. This analysis is useful in three different ways: it improves the translation of SIMD code to non-SIMD CPUs, it helps developers to manually improve their SIMD applications, and it also guides the compiler in the optimization of SIMD programs. We demonstrate this last point by introducing branch fusion, a new compiler optimization that identifies, via a gene sequencing algorithm, chains of similarities between divergent program paths, and weaves these paths together as much as possible. Our implementation has been accepted in the Ocelot open-source CUDA compiler, and is publicly available. We have tested it on many industrial-strength GPU benchmarks, including Rodinia and the Nvidia's SDK. Our divergence analysis has a 34% false-positive rate, compared to the results of a dynamic profiler. Our automatic optimization adds a 3% speed-up onto parallel quick sort, a heavily optimized benchmark. Our manual optimizations extend this number to over 10%.","1089-795X;1089-795X","978-1-4577-1794-9978-0-7695-4566","10.1109/PACT.2011.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113840","CUDA;GPU;SIMD;Compiler;Static Analysis;Divergent Execution;Parallel Execution","Synchronization;Optimization;Graphics processing unit;Logic gates;Semantics;Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware","graphics processing units;optimisation;parallel architectures;program compilers;public domain software;synchronisation","open-source CUDA compiler;Ocelot;branch fusion;synchronization point;processing elements;SIMD execution model;single instruction multiple data;GPU programming;optimizations;divergence analysis","","22","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because model validation plays a key role in system simulation for analysis and optimization of railgun, a novel validation method is proposed in this paper. By utilizing the railgun dynamic test and predicted data, the simulation model is validated based on theil's inequality coefficient (TIC) method. To execute sufficient validation of the model and improve reliability of the validation results, similarity theory is adopted to analyze the credibility of simulation model by comparing the characteristics of the railgun. Inspired by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for multiple attribute decision making, we define the muzzle velocity, current peak and discharging time as evaluation index for assessing the credibility of the simulation model and then evaluation structure is established. The final synthesis results demonstrate the feasibility of the adopted validation method and the validity of the modular model. The whole system model is run under MATLAB software platform, which is divided into several main components encapsulated into classes by object-oriented technology. On the basis of the validated model, an optimization pursuing highest velocity with the constraint of the current peak and the residual current in the rail is carried out to find a set of optimal parameters for the railgun using genetic algorithm.","","978-1-4673-0305-7978-1-4673-0306-4978-1-4673-0304","10.1109/EML.2012.6325055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6325055","modularized design;model validation;similarity theory;analytic hierarchy process;optimization;genetic algorithm;electromagnetic railgun","Mathematical model;Railguns;Optimization;Rails;Object oriented modeling;Projectiles;Analytical models","decision making;discharges (electric);genetic algorithms;railguns;reliability","modular railgun model;electromagnetic railgun structure features;modularization modeling method;model validation;system simulation;railgun analysis;railgun optimization;validation method;railgun dynamic test;Theil inequality coefficient;TIC method;reliability;similarity theory;analytic hierarchy process;AHP;multiple attribute decision making;muzzle velocity;current peak;discharging time;evaluation index;MATLAB software platform;object-oriented technology;residual current;genetic algorithm","","8","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper shows that LR scores can be expressed in terms of the similarity between the supervectors (SVs) formed by stacking the mean vectors of Gaussian mixture models corresponding to the test patterns, the target model, and the background model. By interpreting the support vector machine (SVM) kernels as a specific similarity (or discriminant) function between SVs, this paper shows that LR scoring is a special case of SVM scoring and that most sequence kernels can be obtained by assuming a specific form for the similarity function of SVs. This paper further shows that this assumption can be relaxed to derive a new general kernel. The kernel function is general in that it is a linear combination of any kernels belonging to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The combination weights are obtained by optimizing the ability of a discriminant function to separate the positive and negative classes using either regression analysis or SVM training. The idea was applied to both high-and low-level speaker verification. In both cases, results show that the proposed kernels achieve better performance than several state-of-the-art sequence kernels. Further performance enhancement was also observed when the high-level scores were combined with acoustic scores.","1045-9227;1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2090893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643156","Kernel optimization;sequence kernels;speaker verification;support vector machines","Kernel;Support vector machines;Optimization;Adaptation model;Speech;Measurement;Computational modeling","decision making;Gaussian processes;Hilbert spaces;regression analysis;speaker recognition;support vector machines","optimized discriminative kernel;SVM scoring;speaker verification;decision-making process;binary classification systems;likelihood ratio scores;supervectors;Gaussian mixture models;support vector machine;similarity function;kernel Hilbert space;regression analysis;acoustic scores","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Classification;Discrimination Learning;Humans;Linear Models;Neural Networks (Computer);Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Speech Recognition Software;Voice","8","43","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm can be run every time a node failure occurs due to power failure of the node battery so that it may reschedule the network. This scheduling is modeled as a combinatorial, multiobjective, and constrained optimization problem with energy and noncoverage as the two objectives. The basic evolutionary multiobjective optimizer used is known as decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) which is modified by integrating the concept of fuzzy Pareto dominance. The performance of the resulting algorithm, which is called MOEA/DFD, is compared with the performance of the original MOEA/D, which is another very well known MO algorithm called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and an IBM optimization software package called CPLEX.

In our approach, a programmer changes code inside a project, resulting in before and after source code versions. The difference (the generated transformation) is stored in a database. When presented with some arbitrary code, our tool mines the database to determine which of the generalized transformations possibly apply.

The DMCM operator combines global exploration and local refinement efficiently, which adopts a generation-dependent parameter to guarantee a good balance between global search and local search. Comparison is made to another multi-objective optimization algorithm, nondominated neighbor immune algorithm, termed as NNIA, in solving five ZDT and five DTLZ standard test problems. Simulation results based on coverage of two set, convergence metric and spacing show that DMCMIA performs better than NNIA in generating approximations to the true Pareto front.

"Design aware scheduling of dynamic testbench controlled design element accesses in FPGA-based HW/SW co-simulation systems for fast functional verification","S. Banerjee; T. Gupta","Mentor Graphics India Pvt. Ltd; Mentor Graphics India Pvt. Ltd","2nd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","","2010","","","175","181","In HW/SW co-simulation based logic verification systems, the design under test (DUT) is executed on an FPGA based emulator and the behavioral testbench written in some high level language like C or HDL is run on a SW simulator or a general purpose CPU. In such systems it is essential to reduce the communication between SW and HW sides to enhance overall verification speed. Therefore it is of significant importance to efficiently schedule testbench controlled accesses to design elements like flip-flops, memories etc, which require access to FPGA HW. Such accesses by static HDL testbenches which are specified at design compilation time and are mainly to design IOs are optimized by synthesis of RTL transactors, which make use of specialized high speed links and standardized interfaces like SCE-MI for optimizing the transactions. It is seen that apart from static testbenches, verification engineers and designers often make use of dynamic random access to design elements (e.g a series of register sets) through C or TCL based dynamic testbenches typically specified post design compilation. Such dynamic accesses are not routed through the transaction link and follow a fixed cost scheduling, resulting in sub-optimal communication pattern between SW and HW verification engines. The paper presents a design aware scheduling system for optimizing such dynamic accesses, by extracting and making use of design characteristics for intelligently clubbing and scheduling various read/write accesses while maintaining modeling fidelity. This complements the streaming transaction based interfaces available for static accesses. It is seen that when this scheduling system is implemented in an industry standard FPGA based co-simulator, evaluation fidelity is maintained and significant enhancement in overall functional verification performance is achieved.","","978-1-4244-7808-8978-1-4244-7809-5978-1-4244-7807","10.1109/ASQED.2010.5548239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548239","HW-SW co-verification;Emulation;FPGA","Dynamic scheduling;System testing;Control systems;Job shop scheduling;Logic testing;Field programmable gate arrays;Design optimization;Hardware design languages;Logic design;High level languages","benchmark testing;field programmable gate arrays;formal verification;hardware-software codesign;scheduling","design aware scheduling;FPGA-based HW/SW co-simulation systems;logic verification systems;design under test;FPGA based emulator;dynamic random access;read/write accesses;streaming transaction based interfaces","","4","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Handling Conflicts with Compiler's Help in Software Transactional Memory Systems","S. Mannarswamy; R. Govindarajan","NA; NA","2010 39th International Conference on Parallel Processing","","2010","","","482","491","Atomic sections are supported in software through the use of optimistic concurrency by using Software Transactional Memory (STM). However STM implementations incur high overheads which reduce the wide-spread use of this approach by programmers. Conflicts are a major source of overheads in STMs. The basic performance premise of a transactional memory system is the optimistic concurrency principle wherein data updates executed by the transactions are to disjoint objects/memory locations, referred to as Disjoint Access Parallel (DAP). Otherwise, the updates conflict, and all but one of the transactions are aborted. Such aborts result in wasted work and performance degradation. While contention management systems in STM implementations try to reduce conflicts by various runtime feedback control mechanisms, they are not aware of the application's structure and data access patterns and hence typically act after the conflicts have occurred. In this paper we propose a scheme based on compiler analysis, which can identify static atomic sections whose instances, when executed concurrently by more than one thread always conflict. Such an atomic section is referred to as Always Conflicting Atomic Section (ACAS). We propose and evaluate two techniques Selective Pessimistic Concurrency Control (SPCC) and compiler inserted Early Conflict Checks (ECC) which can help reduce the STM overheads caused by ACAS. We show that these techniques help reduce the aborts in 4 of the STAMP benchmarks by up to 27.52% while improving performance by 1.24% to 19.31%.","0190-3918;0190-3918;2332-5690","978-1-4244-7913-9978-0-7695-4156","10.1109/ICPP.2010.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599190","","Parallel processing;Concurrency control;Runtime;Concurrent computing;Software;Programming;Benchmark testing","concurrency control;data handling;program compilers;shared memory systems;transaction processing","handling conflict;software transactional memory system;atomic section;optimistic concurrency;optimistic concurrency principle;disjoint access parallel;contention management systems;feedback control mechanisms;data access patterns;compiler analysis;static atomic sections;always conflicting atomic section;selective pessimistic concurrency control;early conflict checks","","","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The big inertia, large time delay and nonlinear characteristics of the superheater system for a supercritical boiler are becoming more and more obvious. The conventional cascaded PID control scheme is often difficult to obtain satisfactory steam temperature control effect over wide-range loading conditions. In this paper, an intelligent predictive optimal controller based on neural network (NN) modeling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented for superheated steam temperature control. Aiming at the known drawbacks of the NN predictive optimal controller, a time-delay BP neural network is used to establish the nonlinear dynamic model of the superheater system to improve the model's real-time prediction accuracy and generalization ability. A new simplified high-efficiency PSO algorithm discarding the concept of velocity is adopted to search the optimal controls with faster convergence rate to meet the real-time control demand. An elastic search space is updated dynamically based on the real-time steam temperature control error to prevent oscillation and to enhance stability. By taking a full-scope simulator of a 600MW supercritical power unit as the object investigated, the neural network model of the superheater system is built and trained with historical wide-range operating data. The new control scheme is programmed with MATLAB software and it communicates two-way with the simulator. Extensive control simulation tests are made.

The benchmarks are designed for comparing the problem solving behavior of COIN against a Genetic Algorithm.","","978-1-4673-1921-8978-1-4673-1920-1978-1-4673-1919","10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261923","Coincidence Algorithm;Multimodal Problem;Genetic Algorithm","Genetic algorithms;Benchmark testing;Evolutionary computation;Algorithm design and analysis;Traveling salesman problems;Optimization;Probabilistic logic","genetic algorithms","multimodal problems;coincidence algorithm;multimodal optimization problem;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;GA;COIN","","4","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly with the advent of multicore processors, efficient program optimizations, such as adaptive and speculative parallelism, require accurate and advanced runtime analyses, which inevitably incur a time overhead that has to be minimized. In this paper, we present VMAD, a virtual machine (VM) that handles x86_54 binary files, which are especially tailored at compile time to include instructions and data for code instrumentation and for the VM. VMAD enables low level profiling initiated by the programmer from the source code, through the insertion of a dedicated pragma delimiting the regions of interest. This approach provides the programmer a direct view of the actual execution behavior of the source code. To our knowledge, VMAD is the first proposal providing low-level instrumentation initiated from the source code, with almost negligible runtime overhead.","","978-1-61284-368-1978-1-61284-367","10.1109/ISPASS.2011.5762725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762725","","Instruments;Runtime;Optimization;Assembly;Linux;Benchmark testing;Virtual machining","multiprocessing systems;program compilers;program diagnostics;source coding;virtual machines","VMAD;virtual machine for advanced dynamic analysis;runtime code analysis;processor architectures;multicore processors;program optimization;binary files;code instrumentation;source code;low-level instrumentation;program analysis","","3","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For checking the control capability and control method optimization, hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) system should be established. Attitude stability of aerocraft and propellant consumption of lateral jet system can be analyzed based on the simulation data, then the engineers may evaluate the performance of combined control method. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation system of aerocraft control based on dSPACE is established in this paper, has real-time simulation capability that complicated model calculating needs, and solves the problems of high data communication and rapid development of simulation system in HILS. This paper introduces the hardware architecture and key technologies of the simulation system. Ground simulation of aerocraft attitude is realized with communication between DS4201s card and turn table, feedback voltage acquisition of two actuating mechanism and A/D conversion is solved using DS2002 card, the control algorithm is downloaded to DSP processor in the onboard computer using the RTW tool. Single instrument tests and interaction between two instruments are finished. Testing results of the hardware indicate that communication and signal transferring are proper. Attitude simulation is realized with serial-port communication between dSPACE and turn table, interference in A/D acquisition channel is reduced by adding filtering module in DS2002. Attitude control in the ascending phase of aerocraft is simulated under the HILS environment. Actuator deflection and on-off status of lateral jet system are derived by analyzing HILS results.

SDR technologies are attractive for communication systems because of their reconfigurable capabilities. Due to the complexity of real scenarios, usually characterized by multipath propagation and heterogeneous interfering sources, the antenna plays a key role. It is demonstrated by literature that the use of reconfigurable antennas (known also as smart antennas) could dramatically improve system performance. In this paper, we propose a compact and low-cost antenna array, based on microchip antennas, which will be integrated with a low-cost GNU-radio SDR testbed. The proposed antenna reconfigures its radiation characteristics, turning on/off the array elements, by means of radio frequency (RF) switches. The antenna is software controlled by means of a suitable optimization technique that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Test results can prove the capability of the proposed antenna to improve the performance of SDR telecommunication systems in terms of increased SNR and reduced bit error rate.","1095-323X;1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1978-1-4577-0556-4978-1-4577-0555","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187130","","Arrays;Antenna arrays;Dipole antennas;Software radio;Prototypes;Software","antenna arrays;multipath channels;optimisation;software radio","low-cost reconfigurable antenna array;SDR-based communication systems;software-defined radio communication systems;multipath propagation;heterogeneous interfering sources;microchip antennas;low-cost GNU-radio SDR testbed;radio frequency switches;RF switches;optimization technique;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR","","2","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation and software synthesis for SyncCharts usually involve the compilation into Esterel, which is then further compiled into C code. This can produce efficient code, but has two principal drawbacks: 1) the arbitrary control flow that can be expressed with SyncChart transitions cannot be mapped directly to Esterel, and 2) it is very difficult to map the resulting C code back to the original SyncChart, which hampers traceability. This paper presents an alternative software synthesis approach for SyncCharts that compiles SyncCharts directly into Synchronous C (SC). The compilation preserves the structure of the original SyncChart, which is advantageous for validation and possibly certification. We present a static thread-scheduling scheme that reflects data dependencies and optimizes both the number of used threads as well as the maximal used priorities. This results in SC code with competitive speed and little memory requirements.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-8-6978-1-61284-208-0978-3-9810801-7","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763284","","Semantics;Computational modeling;Instruction sets;Writing;Concurrent computing;Schedules;Optimization","flowcharting;multi-threading;processor scheduling;program compilers;synchronisation","SyncChart compiling;Synchronous C;synchronous statechart variant;reactive systems;deterministic semantics;software synthesis;Esterel;C code;arbitrary control flow;SyncChart transition;static thread-scheduling scheme","","2","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gao","NA; NA; NA; NA","2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","","2011","","","56","63","Program analysis and program optimization seek to improve program performance. There are optimization techniques which are applied to various scopes such as a source file, function or basic block. Inter-procedural program optimization techniques have the scope of source file and analyze the interaction and relationship between different program functions. The techniques analyze the entire translation unit (typically a source file) and optimize the whole translation unit globally instead of just optimizing inside a function. Analyzing and optimizing an entire translation unit increases compilation time drastically because many factors need to be considered during analysis and optimization. The translation unit size can be quite large, containing many functions. Another issue is that functions in different translation units can be more closely related to each other than to the functions within their translation unit. The main goal of this research is grouping or partitioning of closely related program functions into the same translation unit. Our method profiles an application, determines relationship information between program functions and groups closely related functions together. The source code partitioner method improves the processing time of inter-procedural optimization techniques by applying it to a subset of program functions. Partitioning of program functions by analyzing profiling output shows dramatic decrease in compilation time of programs. Our results show we can improve the compiling time in all tested real world benchmarks.","1521-9097","978-0-7695-4576-9978-1-4577-1875","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121260","compiler;optimization;partitioning;instrumentation;betweenness;agglomerative;divisive","Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Optimization;Communities;Mutual information;Software algorithms;USA Councils","program compilers;program diagnostics;program interpreters","source code partitioning;program analysis;program performance;interprocedural program optimization technique;translation unit;source file;program function;program compilation time","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practical work, 2-dimension (2D) entropy method is often used. It segments images by using the gray value of the pixel and the local average gray value of it, and thus provides better results than that of one-dimension entropy. However, for more accurate thresholding, much more time has to pay. Thus, this paper employs a novel approach to 2D threshold selection based on binary coded ant colony optimization algorithm.

In the domain of embedded devices, however, it is not sufficient to look only at this criterion. Since most of these devices are constraint-driven regarding execution time, energy consumption, heat dissipation and other objectives, a good trade-off has to be found to efficiently map applications to multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) devices. Therefore, we developed a fully automated multi-objective aware parallelization framework, which optimizes different objectives at the same time.

Many of these design patterns are based on pools of pre-existing and reusable threads that facilitate incoming service requests. Thread pools limit thread lifecycle overhead (thread creation and destruction) and resource thrashing (thread proliferation). Despite their potential for scalability, thread pools are hard to configure and test because of concurrency risks like synchronization errors and dead lock, and thread pool-specific risks like resource thrashing and thread leakage. Addressing these challenges requires a thorough understanding of the behaviour of the threads in the thread pool. We argue for a methodology to automatically identify and rank deviations in the behaviour of threads based on resource usage.","1092-8138;1092-8138","978-1-61284-308-7978-0-7695-4398","10.1109/ICPC.2011.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5970187","thread-pools;behaviour-based clustering;understanding ULS systems","Instruction sets;Software systems;Software engineering;Measurement;Performance analysis;Instruments","reverse engineering;software architecture;software maintenance","system behaviour comprehension;large-scale software systems;preexisting thread pool;reusable thread pool;thread lifecycle overhead;thread creation;thread destruction;thread proliferation","","3","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Fuzzy clustering and relevance ranking of web search results with differentiating cluster label generation","T. Matsumoto; E.

This is done using a fuzzy transduction-based clustering algorithm (FTCA), which employs a transduction-based relevance model (TRM) to generate document relevance values. These relevance values are used to cluster similar documents, rank them, and facilitate a term frequency based label generator. The membership degrees of documents to fuzzy clusters also facilitates effective detection and removal of overly similar clusters. FTCA is compared against two other established web document clustering algorithms: Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) and Lingo, which are provided by the free open source Carrot<sup>2</sup> Document Clustering Workbench. To measure cluster quality, an extended version of the classic precision measurement is used to take into account relevance and fuzzy clustering, along with recall and F1 score. Results from testing on five different datasets show a considerable clustering quality and performance advantage over STC and Lingo in most cases.","1098-7584;1098-7584","978-1-4244-6921-5978-1-4244-6919-2978-1-4244-6920","10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584771","","Clustering algorithms;Search engines;Web search;Prototypes;Transmission line measurements;Labeling;Testing","fuzzy set theory;Internet;pattern clustering;public domain software;search engines;trees (mathematics)","relevance ranking;differentiating cluster label generation;Web search results clustering engine;search engines;fuzzy transduction-based clustering algorithm;transduction-based relevance model;term frequency;Web document clustering algorithms;suffix tree clustering;Lingo;open source carrot<sup>2</sup> document clustering workbench;precision measurement","","3","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some problems are computationally intensive when it concerns the evaluation of solutions during the search process, making the optimization by evolutionary algorithms a slow process for situations where a quick response from the algorithm is desired (for instance, in online optimization problems). Several ways to overcome this problem, by speeding up convergence time, were proposed, including Cultural Algorithms and Coevolutionary Algorithms. However, these algorithms still have the need to evaluate many solutions on each step of the optimization process. In problems where this evaluation is computationally expensive, the optimization can take a prohibitive time to reach optimal solutions. This work presents an evolutionary algorithm for numerical optimization problems (Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm for Problems based on Numerical Representation - QIEA-R), inspired in the concept of quantum superposition, which allows the optimization process to be carried on with a smaller number of evaluations. It extends previous works by presenting a broader range of tests and improvements on the algorithm.

Early in the design phase the individual components have yet to be built and tested, thus compromising the accuracy of the simulation. In this early period of the design stage, the component models are created by relying solely on their constitutive relationships. Furthermore, it is difficult to incorporate physical effects such as spatial harmonic and nonlinearities into such constitutive based models. Once the design stage reaches the component level, there exists a number of physics simulators for every discipline involved: thermal, mechanical, electromagnetism and fluid dynamics; these simulators, based on numerical methods, provide high fidelity detailed information about the component. However, having an accurate multi-physics virtual model of a system at the 3D level and at the system 0D level remains a challenge. This paper will introduce a methodology to apply simulation at every step of the design cycle, from the early functional design stage to the detailed component optimization to the verification stage of the vehicle dynamics.

Detection accuracy is often used to rank effectiveness of commercial anti-malware programs with less emphasis on the equally important treatment component. Effectiveness measures of commercial anti-malware programs should consider equally detection and treatment. This can be achieved by standardized measurements of both components. This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of a commercial anti-malware program's detection and treatment components against malicious objects by partitioning true positives to incorporate detection and treatment. This new measurement is used to evaluate the effectiveness of four commercial anti-malware programs in three tests. The results show that several anti-malware programs produced numerous incorrectly treated or untreated true positives and false negatives leaving many infected objects unresolved and thereby active threats in the system. These results further demonstrate that our approach evaluates the detection and treatment components of commercial anti-malware programs in a more effective and realistic manner than currently accepted measurements which primarily focus on detection accuracy.","","978-1-4244-9356-2978-1-4244-9353-1978-1-4244-9355","10.1109/MALWARE.2010.5665797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665797","","Malware;Equations;Testing;Software;Mathematical model;Workstations","invasive software;software performance evaluation","commercial anti malware programs;detection evaluation;treatment evaluation","","3","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper approaches this matter by reducing the time needed to create a detection model on very large databases and suggests three different optimization techniques. First, the perceptron algorithm was adjusted to use the map-reduce paradigm in order to make it run in a distribute manner. Second, hardware specific optimizations were applied for faster mathematical computations. Finally, a cache system was used to reduce the quantity of data processed by the algorithm.

Circular array antennas have gained popularity among various antenna configurations used for direction agile applications. This paper presents a planar circular array antenna for base stations in mobile wireless communication systems. The antenna could be electronically steered to give a complete 360 coverage around the base station. The model was created using FEKO Suite 5.4, a Method of Moments (MoM) based electromagnetic simulation software.

We propose a new CC method called RoCoCo (Row and Column Compression), which also compresses the tree along rows so that the final adder is small and fast. Although CC results in faster multipliers in ASIC implementations, it is an assumption by designers that they are not the wisest choice on FPGAs.

This information is essential for conservation and management of this highly endangered species. Currently available units are proprietary designs by few manufacturers and no literature can be found about their internal operation. This lack of published information hampers the evolution and development of future collaring systems with increased features and functionalities for research, conservation and management. Critical issues for improvement include live time of the collar, which is related to power consumption and operational modes of the unites, and remote programmability allowing for changes in data acquisition during deployment. Most commercially available collars lack the ability to change data acquisition schedules remotely over the air, and therefore data acquisition is un-optimized, which is directly responsible for un-optimized power consumption. This research was conducted to develop a satellite elephant collar with improved lifetime and remote programmability. A second purpose of our research was to make information on how to built elephant collars needs to become widely available to the user community,. This paper presents the particular issue of power optimization of satellite elephant collars. A functional test collar was designed using general purpose electronic components and a number of software and hardware optimization methods used during development which are presented in this paper.

A cuvette for biological objects loses stability of measuring at the intensive continuous duty (6-8 hours), and also at measuring of time dependence of complex permittivity (by series for 6 minutes). It was also shown that some features of material of patients have an influence on measurements, i.e. device sensitivity was not enough for statistically reliable differentiation of blood cells reaction on bioactive substances effect. Thus, it was required to rework measuring cuvette. For this purpose the series of calculation experiments were conducted to optimize the waveguide flanges structure of cuvette as well as to fit optimal gaskets thicknesses limiting the sample. It should be take into account sensitivity and feasible implementation of gaskets thicknesses.

Our proposed optimizations, when applied to loops selected from standard benchmark suites, demonstrate an average (geometric mean) 2.5x performance improvement. This improvement is attributed to a 94% success in speculation reuse and a 77% reduction in the number of squashed threads compared to an implementation that, in such cases of squashes, would have squashed all the successors starting from the oldest offending one.","","978-1-4503-0178-7978-1-5090-5032","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7851554","Thread-level speculation;Mis-speculation overhead","Protocols;Optimization;Standards;Benchmark testing;Program processors;Programming","parallel programming;software reusability","speculative loop parallelization;selective squash;speculation reuse;value-based selective squash protocol;optimistic speculation reuse technique;dependency violations","","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Translated code is organized in terms of code blocks in the code cache which transfers execution to the next code block through a control transfer instruction. As the target address of the control transfer instruction is in the form of its source program counter, the code cache system has to check the address mapping table for the translated program counter of the target address before entering the required code block. This will cause the performance degradation. As the target address of the direct control transfer instruction is fixed during the execution of a program, its source target address can be replaced with the translated target address.

This new algorithm eliminates risky event processing in the Time Warp processing stage of the original BTW algorithm and is founded on a concept called ""safe causal relation"". In our new algorithm, the length of any chained rollback operations is limited to at most one and cascading rollback effects found in the original BTW algorithm can be completely avoided. Performance tests of Time Warp, Breathing Time Bucket, Breathing Time Warp and the new Safe BTW algorithms using PHOLD model show that the new algorithm obtains better speedups as the computation scales up. Its effective event processing time as a percentage of the total event processing time is higher than that of Time Warp and Breathing Time Warp, proving that excessive rollback operations are successfully controlled. And the extra synchronization overhead it introduces is still much lower than that of Breathing Time Bucket itself and is within tolerable and stable level as the computation scales up.","1087-4097","978-1-4673-1797","10.1109/PADS.2012.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305888","","Synchronization;Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Process control;Parallel processing;Conferences","software performance evaluation;synchronisation;time warp simulation","SafeBTW algorithm;nonrisky synchronisation algorithm;scalable optimistic synchronization algorithm;parallel discrete event simulation;PDES;risky event processing elimination;time warp processing stage;safe causal relation concept;chained rollback operations;breathing time bucket algorithm;breathing time warp algorithm;PHOLD model","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FHACC tends to agglomerate such communities that share the most common vertices into larger ones. Its running time on a sparse network with n vertices and m edges is O(mkÌ + mt), where kÌ denotes the mean vertex degree, and t is the iteration times of community agglomeration in FHACC algorithm.

We apply the formulas used in the definition of the optimization problem to empirical defect data of an experiment previously conducted with university students. The results show that the optimal choice of the number of persons depends on the actual defect detection probabilities of the individual defects over time, but also on the size of the effort budget.

Traditional redundancy techniques are expensive for designing energy-efficient systems that are resilient to high error rates. We present Error Resilient System Architecture (ERSA), a low-cost robust system architecture for emerging killer probabilistic applications such as Recognition, Mining and Synthesis (RMS) applications. While resilience of such applications to errors in low-order bits of data is well-known, execution of such applications on error-prone hardware significantly degrades output quality (due to high-order bit errors and crashes). ERSA achieves high error resilience to high-order bit errors and control errors (in addition to low-order bit errors) using a judicious combination of 3 key ideas: (1) asymmetric reliability in many-core architectures, (2) error-resilient algorithms at the core of probabilistic applications, and (3) intelligent software optimizations. Error injection experiments on a multi-core ERSA hardware prototype demonstrate that, even at very high error rates of 20,000 errors/second/core or 2Ã10<sup>-4</sup> error/cycle/core (with errors injected in architecturally-visible registers), ERSA maintains 90% or better accuracy of output results, together with minimal impact on execution time, for probabilistic applications such as K-Means clustering, LDPC decoding and Bayesian networks. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ERSA in tolerating high rates of static memory errors that are characteristic of emerging challenges such as Vccmin problems and erratic bit errors. Using the concept of configurable reliability, ERSA platforms may also be adapted for general-purpose applications that are less resilient to errors (but at higher costs).","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-6-2978-1-4244-7054-9978-3-9810801-6","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457059","","Error correction;Computer architecture;Hardware;Error analysis;Resilience;Redundancy;Energy efficiency;Robustness;Control system synthesis;Degradation","belief networks;data mining;hardware-software codesign;optimisation;pattern clustering;probability;reliability theory","ERSA;error resilient system architecture;probabilistic applications;redundancy techniques;RMS;recognition mining and synthesis;asymmetric reliability;intelligent software optimizations;K-means clustering;LDPC decoding;Bayesian networks","","79","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This Regional COPSS is based on patented fourDscapeÂ® software technology, developed over the past decade by Long Island, NY-based Balfour Technologies. This powerful fourDscape augmented virtual reality technology has been effectively applied to local and regional emergency management operations and can be deployed nationally to deliver comprehensive situational awareness in support of safety, security and emergency preparedness, prevention, mitigation, response and recovery operations at all levels. A fourDscape browser/server-based COPSS is designed as an open, multi-layered service/resource oriented networked architecture (SOA/ROA, i.e. âcloudâ) capable of (1) integrating and managing a multitude of disparate data sources of all types (including live and static data feeds); (2) interoperability with numerous other vendors information systems, COPs, information sharing frameworks, notification and alerting systems, analytics, etc.; and (3) sharing and passing information and comprehensive, timely situational awareness between first responders at the incident site, incident commanders, and emergency managers and decision makers at local, regional and national emergency operations centers across the country. And consistent with the recent Presidential Policy Directive on National Preparedness (PPD-8), this fourDscape COPSS capabilities and framework represents currently operational technology that can achieve an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation [capabilities-based] preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources. Next Generation COPSS such as fourDscape need to be open and scalable to facilitate global information sharing; deliver information in an easy-to-understand augmented virtual reality common operating picture; be easy-to-use walk-up technology with a full complement of embedded training/simulation capability; provide for effective information assurance; and be compliant and effective in executing national preparedness goals.

Unfortunately, automatic parallelization of loops is a fragile process, many different obstacles affect or prevent it in practice. To address this predicament we developed an interactive compilation feedback system that guides programmers in iteratively modifying their application source code. This helps leverage the compiler's ability to generate loop-parallel code. We employ our system to modify two sequential benchmarks dealing with image processing and edge detection, resulting in scalable parallelized code that runs up to 8.3 times faster on an eight-core Intel Xeon 5570 system and up to 12.5 times faster on a quad-core IBM POWER6 system. Benchmark performance varies significantly between the systems. This suggests that semi-automatic parallelization should be combined with target-specific optimizations. Furthermore, comparing the first benchmark to manually-parallelized, hand-optimized pthreads and OpenMP versions, we find that code generated using our approach typically outperforms the pthreads code (within 93-339%). It also performs competitively against the OpenMP code (within 75-111%).

Although high performance computing systems provide massive parallelism and computing power to fulfill the crucial requirements of the scientific applications, the I/O tasks of high-end applications do not scale. Strict data consistency semantics adopted from traditional file systems are inadequate for homogeneous parallel computing platforms. For high performance parallel applications independent I/O is critical, particularly if checkpointing data are dynamically created or irregularly partitioned. In particular, parallel programs generating a large number of unrelated I/O accesses on large-scale systems often face serious I/O serializations introduced by lock contention and conflicts at file system layer. As these applications may not be able to utilize the I/O optimizations requiring process synchronization, they pose a great challenge for parallel I/O architecture and software designs. We propose an I/O mechanism to bridge the gap between scientific applications and parallel storage systems. A static file domain partitioning method is developed to align the I/O requests and produce a client-server mapping that minimizes the file lock acquisition costs and eliminates the lock contention. Our performance evaluations of production application I/O kernels demonstrate scalable performance and achieve high I/O bandwidths.","1045-9219;1558-2183;2161-9883","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871604","Parallel I/O;I/O delegation;MPI-IO;non collective I/O;collaborative caching;parallel file systems;file locking.","Servers;Kernel;Bandwidth;Optimization;Benchmark testing;Multicore processing;Performance evaluation","client-server systems;data analysis;data integrity;file organisation;information retrieval;input-output programs;optimisation;parallel architectures;parallel programming;performance evaluation;software architecture","delegation-based I-O mechanism;high performance computing system;periodic data checkpointing;post-run data analysis;high end application;strict data consistency semantics;homogeneous parallel computing platform;high performance parallel application;parallel program;unrelated I-O access;large scale system;I-O serialization;lock contention;file system layer;I-O optimization;process synchronization;parallel I-O architecture;software design;parallel storage system;static file domain partitioning method;I-O request;client-server mapping;file lock acquisition cost;lock contention;performance evaluation;production application I-O kernel;high I-O bandwidth","","10","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The composite image filter has a tree structure, with its nodes consisting of multiple simple image filters, arithmetic operators, arithmetic functions, constant values, and the pixel value of the input image. Genetic programming (GP) optimizes the tree structure based on the visual inspection of the IGP users, i.e. filter designers. Ten filter designers design composite filters using three methods: an IGP-based design method, a manual-based design method, and using the photo-retouching features of a commercial software program to time-sequentially apply ready-made filters. The designers make filters that output images corresponding to the given design concepts - relaxed and violent - based on their visual inspection. Twenty subjects compare the obtained images in pairs and evaluate which image is closer to achieving the give design concept.

To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations were carried out on the IEEE 39 bus test system using the PSS/E software. Test results show that the proposed approach can effectively differentiate the fault, stable swing and unstable swing with a good accuracy.","","978-1-4577-0354-6978-1-4577-0355-3978-1-4577-0353","10.1109/PEOCO.2011.5970431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5970431","Distance relay;Artificial Neural Network (ANN);S-transform;fault;stable swing and unstable swing","Artificial neural networks;Neurons;Protective relaying;Power system stability;Generators;Feature extraction","feature extraction;neural nets;power system analysis computing;relay protection;transforms","power swing detection;distance relay operation;S-transform;feature extraction;artificial neural network;IEEE 39 bus test system;PSS/E software","","1","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Supporting said complex systems such as the MV-22/CV-22 aircraft requires being able to troubleshoot and mitigate complex failure modes in dynamic operational environments. Since an aircraft is comprised of multiple systems designed by specialty sub-vendors and subsequently brought together by an aircraft integrator, diagnostics at the aircraft level are usually âgood enoughâ but not capable of 100% fault isolation to a single component. Today's system components must be highly integrated and are required to communicate via high speed data-bus conduits which require precise synchronization between systems. Failure modes of aircraft are identified via design, analysis and test prior to fielding of the weapon system. However, not all failure modes are typically known at the time of system Initial Operational Capability, but rather are found in the field by maintainers/pilots and then subsequently mitigated with aircraft engineering changes or system replacements. Also, the requirement for increased capabilities can drive the need for new systems to be integrated into an aircraft system that may not have been considered in the initial design and support concept. There is a plethora of maintenance action detail collected by pilots, maintenance officers (MO) and engineers that can and should be used to identify failure mode trends that come to light during the operational phase of an aircraft. New troubleshooting techniques can be developed to address underlying failure modes to increase efficiency of future maintenance actions thus reducing the logistics trail required to support the aircraft. The elements available for analysis are maintenance results input by the MO/pilot, (including free form comments regarding problems and resulting actions), Built-In-Test (BIT) fault codes recorded during a flight, and off-aircraft test equipment (such as Consolidated Automated Support System CASS) historical test results. The Integrated Support Environment (ISE) is collecting the data required to perform analysis of underlying maintenance trends that can be identified using some specialized software data mining tools such as text mining of corrective action and maintainer comments data fields from maintenance results. The findings or knowledge extracted from text mining can be correlated back to fault codes recorded during flight and historical maintenance results to help mitigate issues with broken troubleshooting procedures causing headaches to the our Sailors and Marines in the field. By tagging key phrases from the maintainer's/pilot's remarks, knowledge can be gleaned into how the aircraft fails in vigorous environments. The premise of this research is to first choose an apparent high failure avionics system on the V-22 aircraft that is experiencing a high removal rate from the aircraft but subsequently found to be fully operational when tested on CASS. The results of this analysis should present potential root causes for âCannot Duplicateâ situations by recommending an augmentation of diagnostics at the aircraft level to avoid removing and replacing a system that has not failed even though it has reported bad via the aircraft diagnostics. This research will utilize the Net-Centric Diagnostics Framework (NCDF) to retrieve past Smart Test Program Set (TPS) results/BIT sequence strings as a variable for identifying trends in V-22 aircraft maintenance actions. The results of the research will be socialized with the V-22 avionics Fleet Support Team and the Comprehensive Automated Maintenance Environment Optimized (CAMEO) for validation of findings before any troubleshooting changes are recommended. If required, the Integrated Diagnostics and Automated Test Systems group will perform an engineering analysis of problem and suggest an enhanced diagnostic technique to mitigate the issue.","1558-4550;1088-7725;1088-7725","978-1-4244-9363-0978-1-4244-9362-3978-1-4244-9361","10.1109/AUTEST.2011.6058773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058773","V-22;data-mining;text-mining;maintenance actions;diagnostics","Maintenance engineering;Aircraft;Text mining;Aerospace electronics;Predictive models;Aircraft propulsion","aerospace computing;aircraft maintenance;built-in self test;data mining;military aircraft;military computing;weapons","Naval Air Systems Command;NAVAIR;highly complex aircraft weapon systems;MV-22-CV-22 aircraft flight data mining;complex failure mode mitigation;aircraft integrator;high speed data-bus conduits;initial operational capability;aircraft engineering;maintenance action plethora;maintenance officers;MO;troubleshooting techniques;logistic reduction;built-in-test fault codes;BIT fault codes;off-aircraft test equipment;integrated support environment;ISE;specialized software data mining tools;text mining;fault codes;apparent high failure avionics system;CASS;aircraft diagnostics;net-centric diagnostic framework;NCDF;smart test program set;TPS;V-22 aircraft maintenance actions;V-22 avionics fleet support team;comprehensive automated maintenance environment optimized;CAMEO;engineering analysis;enhanced diagnostic technique;Integrated Diagnostics and Automated Test System group","","","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To consider concurrent accesses to shared resources like caches accurately during a source-level simulation, an extension of the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard for reducing the necessary synchronization overhead is proposed as well.

There are a number of advantages to this approach. First, the ability to closely match and minimise the resource requirements (e.g., power consumption and communications protocols) to those that are suitable for the intended deployment. Second, as an entire hardware and software stack is often designed or at least optimised for each deployment, the latest advances can be quickly incorporated. However, this model generally requires the expertise of hardware and software engineers to design and build the system. In turn, this increases the cost and tends to shift the focus away from the initial science towards the development of the wireless sensor networks. This paper explores the utility and practicality of building wireless sensor networks based on commercially available embedded single board computing platforms using standard consumer operating systems. Our test bed was built using Gumstix computing platform, running a Linux Operating System (OS) with a java-based middleware coupled to low-cost scientific grade sensors.

Given the intricate and heterogeneous nature of current clouds, the cloud service selection process is, in effect, a multi criteria optimization or decision-making problem. The possible criteria for this process are related to both functional and nonfunctional attributes of cloud services. In this context, the two major issues are: (1) choice of a criteria-set and (2) mechanisms for the assessment of cloud services against each criterion for thorough continuous cloud service monitoring. In this paper, we focus on the issue of cloud service monitoring wherein the existing monitoring and assessment mechanisms are entirely dependent on various benchmark tests which, however, are unable to accurately determine or reliably predict the performance of actual cloud applications under a real workload. We discuss the recent research aimed at achieving this objective and propose a novel user-feedback-based approach which can monitor cloud performance more reliably and accurately as compared with the existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4673-1233-2978-0-7695-4687","10.1109/CISIS.2012.157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6245621","Cloud Computing;Service Selection;Cloud Services;User Feedback;Cloud Monitoring","Monitoring;Cloud computing;Benchmark testing;Quality of service;Reliability;Educational institutions","cloud computing;decision making;optimisation;software performance evaluation;system monitoring","user feedback;cloud service monitoring;federated cloud computing;intelligent cloud service selection;multicriteria optimization;decision-making problem;functional attribute;nonfunctional attribute;criteria-set;cloud service assessment;continuous cloud service monitoring;user-feedback-based approach;cloud performance monitoring","","18","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to that the melting point of lead-free solder is 217Â°C, which is nearly 34Â°C higher than lead solder 183Â°C. If the solder curve is used to implement welding, the lead-free pins are not molten while the component is being sent into cooling area, which must lead to delamination between solders and solder pastes. And if the solder-free curve is used, crystal grains of the solder pasts will be thick due to the high temperature. That will make the welding poor. In order to avoid the defects above in the mixed assembly, a set of process parameters are needed to determine a correct reflow curve. To direct at a high density mixed assembly, a component equivalent model is established using Ansys software. The reflow process is simulated under ERSA reflow-oven with 12 zones. L9 (34) orthogonal tests are designed to analysis the four main process parameters, which include Conveyor belt speed A, Preheating temperature B, Heat preservation temperature C, Reflow temperature D, on the influence of the five key indexes including heating rate V<sub>up</sub>, cooling rate V<sub>down</sub>, temperature difference ÎT, peak temperature T<sub>peak</sub>, time t<sub>1</sub>above 217Â°C. According to the temperature distribution, process parameters are adjusted. Finally, the optimal process parameters are determined. The results show that when the conveyor belt speed is set to 690mm/min, preheating temperature 160Â°C, and heat preservation temperature 170Â°C, reflow temperature 245Â°C, the reflow curve can meet the five key indexes, which can ensure the welding quality of the mixed assembly.","","978-1-4673-1681-1978-1-4673-1682-8978-1-4673-1680","10.1109/ICEPT-HDP.2012.6474751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474751","High density;Mixed assembly;Lead and lead-free;Orthogonal text;Optimization and Analysis","Indexes;Plastics;Heating;Assembly;Substrates;Arrays","belts;conveyors;cooling;delamination;electronics industry;lead;melting point;optimisation;printed circuit manufacture;soldering;solders;temperature distribution;welding","mixed reflow soldering;lead-free solder;lead solder;high density assembly;packing density;assembly material;lead-free craft;electronic industry switches;transitional phase;lead-free-mixed lead solder joints;solder curve;lead-free pins;cooling area;solder-free curve;correct reflow curve;process parameters;high density mixed assembly;Ansys software;ERSA reflow-oven;L9 orthogonal tests;process parameters;conveyor belt speed;preheating temperature;heat preservation temperature;reflow temperature;heating rate;cooling rate;temperature difference;peak temperature;temperature distribution process parameters;optimal process parameters;welding quality","","","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical categories of malicious code include Trojan Horses, viruses, worms etc. With the growth in complexity of computing systems, detection of malicious code is becoming horrendously complex. For security of embedded devices it is important to ensure the integrity of software running in it. The general virus detection is undecidable. However, in the case of embedded systems or personal systems, the software and hardware configurations are known a priori. We are experimenting to see whether we can certify such systems for malware freedom. Most of the current efforts on malware detection rely heavily on detection of syntactic patterns. Malware writers are resorting to simple syntactic transformations (which preserve the program semantics) such as various compiler optimizations and program obfuscation techniques to evade detection. Our work is based on semantic behaviour of programs. We are working towards developing a model of the behaviour of a program executing in an environment. Our approach to detect tampering is based on benchmarking the behaviour of a program executing in an environment, and then matching the observed behaviour of the program in a similar environment with the benchmark (a la translation validation in a sense or bisimulation that is widely used in model checking). Since execution behaviour remains the same in majority of obfuscations, our approach is resilient to such exploits. We have performed several experiments in this direction and obtained encouraging results. Differences between the benchmarked behaviour and the observed behaviour quantifies the damage due to a virus. This enables us to arrive at refined notions of ""harm"" done by a virus and appropriate measures for protection.","1558-1225;0270-5257","978-1-60558-719","10.1145/1810295.1810323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062153","","Malware;Benchmark testing;Software;Syntactics;Hardware;USA Councils","invasive software","malware;Trojan horses;viruses;worms;computing systems;malicious code detection;security;embedded devices;virus detection;personal systems;syntactic patterns;compiler optimization;program obfuscation","","","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among all power disturbances, voltage sags are considered as the most frequent type of disturbances and their impact on sensitive loads is severe. To monitor these disturbances, voltage sag recorders (VSR) must be installed. However, installation of VSRs at all buses in the system is not economical and it needs to be minimized. This paper presents a sag monitor positioning algorithm which finds the optimal number and location of VSRs in the power distribution system.

In this paper we present a rate-distortion optimization approach to the quantization of video coding. This approach is able to balance between rate and distortion for quantization and enhance the overall quality of the entire coding system, with only a slight increase in computational overhead.

In this paper, we propose a novel error-recovery management scheme, which is based upon re-engineering the instruction set. We take the native instruction set of the processor and enhance the microinstructions with additional micro-operations which enable checkpointing. The recovery mechanism is implemented by three custom instructions, which recover the registers which were changed, the data memory values which were changed and the special registers (PC, status registers etc.) which were changed. Our checkpointing storage is changed according to the benchmark executed. Results show that our method degrades performance by just 1.45% under fault free conditions, and incurs area overhead of 45% on average and 79% in the worst case.

The GNSS receiver under development is a high-performance equipment specially designed and optimized for the needs and constraints of small platforms for which small volume, low mass and low power consumption are important parameters. This equipment is based on COTS (Commercials off The Shelf) in order to exploit the performance of the advanced technology developed for terrestrial applications and to reduce significantly the global cost of the equipment. The structure of this GNSS receiver is organized around a reconfigurable architecture with the use of one FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) associated with one DSP (Digital Signal Processor). The GNSS function is then split in two main parts according to the real time requirements of the processing and navigation operations. The hardware (HW) architecture has been optimized to be able to support a low power mode through a fractioned activity that has been implemented by introducing standby time frames during the mission. An orbital extrapolator is also implemented for propagating position and velocity without pseudo range measurements. This receiver is able to process GPS (L1) and GALILEO (E1) signals simultaneously in the first version of the software and will be able to evolve in a second step to a dual frequency mode, compatible with E5a/E1, or with E5b/E1.

In particular, VMs are rewarding in the context of mixed-criticality applications to provide isolation between critical and non-critical tasks running on the same processor. In this paper, we study the design of a real-time system based on a VM monitor/hypervisor that supports multiple VMs/domains. Since each VM in the system runs several real-time tasks, scheduling the VMs leads to a hierarchical scheduling problem. So far, most published techniques for analyzing hierarchical scheduling deal with the schedulabil-ity problem, i.e., for a given hierarchical scheduler, testing whether a set of real-time tasks meet their deadlines. In this paper, we are rather concerned with the synthesis of hier-archical/VM schedulers; that is, how to design a scheduler such that all real-time tasks running on the different VMs meet their deadlines. We consider a setup where the tasks are scheduled on multiple VMs under fixed priorities according to the Deadline Monotonic (DM) policy. The VMs are scheduled under fixed priorities on a Rate Monotonic (RM) basis using one or more processors. A partitioned scheduling of VMs is considered, i.e., VMs are not allowed to migrate from one processor to the other. In this context, we propose a method for selecting optimum time slices and periods for each VM in the system. Our goal is to configure the VM scheduler such that not only all tasks are schedulable but also the minimum possible resources are used. Finally, to illustrate the proposed design technique, we present a case study based on automotive control applications.","","978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0712","10.1145/2039370.2039378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062302","Real-Time Scheduling;Virtual Machines;Embedded Software","Real time systems;Scheduling;Program processors;Processor scheduling;Time factors;Delta modulation;Monitoring","automotive engineering;control engineering computing;embedded systems;processor scheduling;program testing;virtual machines","VM scheduler design;embedded real-time application;virtual machines;platform-independent software development;mixed-criticality application;noncritical tasks;critical tasks;VM monitor;hierarchical scheduling problem;schedulability problem;multiple VM;deadline monotonic policy;rate monotonic basis;partitioned scheduling;automotive control applications","","3","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the algorithm implementation is likely to be more complex and less computationally efficient than would otherwise be required for an algorithm that does not have to contend with the singularities. We show that the revised simplex method introduced by Rusin provides a guarantee of nonsingularity when solving for the search direction. This method provides for a simpler and more computationally efficient implementation, as it avoids the need to test for rank degeneracies and also the need to modify factorizations or solution methods based upon those rank degeneracies. In our approach, we take advantage of the guarantee of nonsingularity by implementing an efficient method for solving the search direction and show that our algorithm is competitive with SVM-QP and also that it is a particularly effective when the fraction of nonbound support vectors is large.

This is especially true in buildings which involve complex interactions, such as ventilation, solar gains, internal gains and thermal mass. Performance monitoring requires collecting data concerning energy consumption and ambient environmental conditions to model and optimise buildings' energy consumption. This paper details the use of data mining techniques in understanding building energy performance of geothermal, solar and gas burning energy systems. The paper is part of an outgoing research into optimisation of building performance under hybrid energy regimes. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to predict comfort levels based on the Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system performance and external environmental conditions. A C4.5 classification methodology is used to analyse a combination of internal and external ambient conditions. The mining algorithms are used to determine comfort constraints and the influence of external conditions on a building's internal user comfort. To test the performance of classification and its use in prediction, different offices, one to the south and the other to the north of the building are used. Classification rules being developed are analysed for their application to modify control algorithms and to apply results to generalise hybrid system performance. The results of this study can be generalised for an entire building, or a set of buildings, under a single energy network subject to the same constraints.","","978-89-88678-22-0978-1-4244-7324","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542881","sensors;HVAC;energy;performance;multi-dimension;classification;data mining","Thermal management;Data mining;Energy consumption;Energy management;System performance;Wireless sensor networks;Solar power generation;Ventilation;Condition monitoring;Heating","building management systems;data mining;energy consumption;HVAC;optimisation;pattern classification;power engineering computing;wireless sensor networks","data mining techniques;building energy consumption optimisation;thermal comfort management;performance monitoring;wireless sensors;ambient environmental conditions;geothermal energy systems;solar energy systems;gas burning energy systems;heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system;C4.5 classification methodology","","1","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In ESPI the speckle interferometry data of the object under different loading conditions are stored as digital images and then converted into interference fringes by digital subtraction or by addition method. These interference patterns correspond to surface displacements, which in turn relates to the strain variation in the specimen. Defects in the specimen produce a strain concentration on loading and generate a fringe anomaly in the interferogram. These anomalies in the interferogram are analyzed for the characterisation of defects in the material. This technique is used as an effective tool in Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). In this paper a method for on-line analysis of ESPI fringe patterns for the qualitative evaluation in the materials is presented.

By exploring a huge microarchitectural design space on the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF), we are capable of generating a set of selective rules on key design parameters. Applying these rules at early design stage effectively identifies the configurations that are inherently reliable to soft errors. Furthermore, we propose a generic approach capable of generating a set of âuniversalâ rules that achieves the optimization of the output variable for different programs in execution. The effectiveness of the universal rule set is validated on programs that are not used in training. This cross-program capability is very useful in the era of multi-threading. Finally, the proposed scheme is extended to multiprocessors where multiple design metrics including reliability, performance and power are balanced. Our proposed methodology is able to generate quantitative and universal solutions for both uniprocessors and multiprocessors.","","978-1-61284-368-1978-1-61284-367","10.1109/ISPASS.2011.5762741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762741","soft error;architectural vulnerability factor;cross-program;design parameter selection;multi-objective optimization","Program processors;Benchmark testing;Registers;Reliability engineering;Training;Input variables","logic design;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;optimisation;query formulation","soft error resilient processors;high-performance processors;on-chip transistor density;patient rule induction method;microarchitectural design space;architectural vulnerability factor;optimization;universal rule set;cross-program capability;multithreading;multiprocessors;multiple design metrics;reliability","","4","36","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, the cost of post-Si validation now represents a large fraction of the total design cost. This work describes a hybrid post-Si approach to validate a modern load-store queue.

The big challenges in device variability and reliability are driven by uncommon tails in distributions, infrequent upsets, one-size-fits-all technology requirements, and a lack of information about the context of each operation. Solutions co-designed across traditional layer boundaries in our system stack can change the game, allowing architecture and software (a) to compensate for uncommon variation, environments, and events, (b) to pass down invariants and requirements for the computation, and (c) to monitor the health of collections of devices. Cross-layer codesign provides a path to continue extracting benefits from further scaled technologies despite the fact that they may be less predictable and more variable.

Currently, the solution is mainly the technique of inline caching, which can be divided into two categories: monomorphic inline caching and polymorphic inline caching. Because of the simple implementation of monomorphic inline caching, it is more commonly used, but it cannot resolve the problem of frequently seeing different types of objects at one call site. Although polymorphic inline caching can solve this problem, it is costly. This paper presents the CAM hardware table, proposes a virtual method invoking mechanism based on software and hardware co-design. It solves the problem of frequently seeing different types of objects at one call site, and does not introduce additional overhead.

This paper proposes a modified version of the perceptron algorithm able to detect malware samples while training at a low rate (even zero) of false positives. A very low number of false positives is crucial because in a real life situation detecting a clean file as malware can destroy the operating system or render other programs unusable. We also provide a method of optimizing the training speed for the algorithm while maintaining the same accuracy. The resulted algorithm can be used in an ensemble or voting system to increase detection and eliminate false positives.","","978-1-4673-5026","10.1109/SYNASC.2012.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481037","Perceptron;one side class;reducing false positives;large dataset;data mining;distributed algorithms","Training;Malware;Databases;Classification algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Educational institutions","data mining;distributed algorithms;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);operating systems (computers)","optimized zero false positives perceptron training;malware detection;machine learning techniques;detection system automation;perceptron algorithm;operating system;clean file detection;training speed optimization;ensemble system;voting system;data mining;distributed algorithms","","12","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes an assignment acceptance strategy in a Modified PSO Algorithm to elevate local optima in solving class scheduling problems. The assignments which reduce the value of objective function will be totally accepted and the assignment which increases or maintains the value of objective function will be accepted based on acceptance probability. Five combinations of acceptance probabilities for both types of assignments were tested in order to see their effect in helping particles moving out from local optima and also their effect towards the final penalty of the solution. The performance of the proposed technique was measured based on percentage penalty reduction (%PR). Five sets of data from International Timetabling Competition were used in the experiment. The experimental results shows that the acceptance probability of 1 for neutral assignment and 0 for negative assignments managed to produce the highest percentage of penalty reduction. This combination of acceptance probability was able to elevate the particle stuck at the local optima which is one of the unwanted situations in solving optimization problems.","","978-1-4244-7122-5978-1-4244-7121-8978-1-4244-7120","10.1109/CSPA.2010.5545252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5545252","Particle Swarm Optimization;Timetabling;Scheduling","Scheduling algorithm;Signal processing algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Application software;Processor scheduling;Systems engineering and theory;Computer science;Testing;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","particle swarm optimisation;probability;scheduling","assignment acceptance strategy;modified PSO algorithm;local optima;solving class scheduling problem;acceptance probability","","","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"17.5um thin Cu wire bonding for fragile low-K wafer technology","Teo Chen Kim Jude","Infineon Technologies Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., 168 Kallang Way Singapore 349253","2010 12th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference","","2010","","","355","358","This paper describes the challenges of a 17.5um thin bare Cu wire bonding on aluminum bond pads for a fragile low-k wafer technology, on a BGA package. Previous evaluations have so far focused on 20um and 25um bare Cu wires as a suitable low cost replacement for Au wires. To improve performance, more fragile low-k wafer technology is being developed. In the past, some key technical challenges experienced are the substantial aluminum splash and potential cracks underneath the bond pads. This paper will focus on using a thin Cu wire of 17.5um diameter to address the smaller BPO of 44um, with very minimal aluminum splash, and prevent any cracks on a fragile low-k construction. As copper is a harder material than aluminum, to make a good bonding interconnect between the two metals and yet addressing these concerns, is critical. Also, the bonded ball bond should have a sufficient amount of remnant aluminum to survive reliability test. As Cu oxidation is rampant, an inert environment of a forming gas of 95N<sub>2</sub>5H<sub>2</sub> is needed to contain this aspect in order to achieve a good wire bond. To address the small BPO and with the aluminum splash which will pose the likelihood of shorting between adjacent ball bonds, a small bonded ball bond size is important. Process parameter optimization coupled with wire bonder hardware and software capabilities are crucial. Acknowledging these concerns, the selection of the capillary was given much thought. Such a capillary must achieve the small bonded ball bond desired, and in association with process optimization, minimize the aluminum splash, ensure remnant aluminum, and finally to address any potential damage to the fragile lowk construction underneath the bond pads. The prescribed approach would be to use a lower set of bond process parameters. Hence, the selected capillary design must be able to achieve such criteria. Evaluations on a wire bonder equipped with a Cu kit, using a 17.5um thin bare Cu wire together with a special low-k capillary design, and with a bonding temperature of 150 deg C, showed promising initial data. At time zero, all traditional wire bond process buy-off criteria are met. However, some lifted ball bonds were observed during the wire pull, with the readings greater than 2gf criteria. Further optimization and refinement is needed. Of course, the necessary reliability test data must follow suit. Also, cross-sectional analysis did not reveal any damage or cracks to the fragile low-k regions below the bond pads. Cu wire to aluminum bond pad interface creates an intermetallics phase that is prone to corrosion after certain stress test conditions. Some studies have shown that the addition of Pd, or Palladium, can overcome this corrosion. With this in mind, the evaluations also include using a Pd coated Cu wire of similar size. Like the bare Cu wire, time zero data showed viability for the Pd coated wire as well. In fact, initial data showed an improvement over the bare Cu wire for standard wire bond process buy-off criteria. The above evaluations have demonstrated that a 17.5um thin bare Cu as well as Pd coated thin Cu wires showed somewhat similar positive initial results on a low-k wafer. Of course there are still many technical challenges as well as reliability considerations to overcome, before the proliferation of 17.5um Cu wire on such a fragile wafer technology.","","978-1-4244-8562-8978-1-4244-8560-4978-1-4244-8561","10.1109/EPTC.2010.5702662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702662","","Wire;Copper;Aluminum;Bonding;Reliability;Electronics packaging","aluminium alloys;ball grid arrays;copper alloys;corrosion;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;lead bonding;oxidation;wafer bonding","wire bonding;fragile low-K wafer technology;BGA package;bonding interconnect;reliability test;oxidation;aluminum splash;ball bond size;process parameter optimization;capillary design;cross-sectional analysis;aluminum bond pad interface;intermetallics phase;stress test condition;corrosion;size 17.5 mum;temperature 150 C","","1","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 2010 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicted that bio-medical chips will soon revolutionize the healthcare market. These bio-medical chips should be able to sense and actuate, store and manipulate data, and transmit information. To realize such bio-medical chips, the integration of embedded systems and microfluidics inevitably leads to a new research dimension for More than Moore and beyond. This tutorial will introduce attendees to the emerging technology of digital microfluidics, which is poised to play a key role in the transformation of healthcare and the interplay between biochemistry and embedded systems. Advances in droplet-based âdigitalâ microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochip devices for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of nanoliter-volume droplets of biochemical samples and reagents. Therefore, integrated circuit (IC) technology can be used to transport and transport âchemical payloadâ in the form of micro/nanofluidic droplets. As a result, non-traditional biomedical applications and markets (e.g., high-throughout DNA sequencing, portable and point-of-care clinical diagnostics, protein crystallization for drug discovery), and fundamentally new uses are opening up for ICs and systems. However, continued growth (and larger revenues resulting from technology adoption by pharmaceutical and healthcare companies) depends on advances in chip integration and design-automation tools. In particular, design-automation tools are needed to ensure that biochips are as versatile as the macro-labs that they are intended to replace. This is therefore an opportune time for the semiconductor industry and circuit/system designers to make an impact in this emerging field. This tutorial offers attendees an opportunity to bridge the semiconductor ICs/systems industry with the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. The audience will see how a âbiochip compilerâ can translate protocol descriptions provided by an end user (e.g., a chemist or a nurse at a doctor's clinic) to a set of optimized and executable fluidic instructions that will run on the underlying digital microfluidic platform. Testing techniques will be described to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. Sensor integration and close coupling between the underlying hardware and the control software in a cyberphysical framework will also be described. A number of case studies based on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed in appropriate places throughout the tutorial. Commercial devices and advanced prototypes from the major company in this market segment (Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc.) will be described, and ongoing activity on newborn screening using digital microfluidic biochips at several large hospitals in Illinois will be highlighted. The topics covered in the tutorial include the following: 1) Technology and application drivers: Motivation and background, actuation methods, electrowetting and digital microfluidics, review of micro-fabrication processes, applications to biochemistry, medicine, and laboratory procedures. 2) System-level design automation: Synthesis techniques: scheduling of fluidic operations, resource binding (mapping of operations to on-chip resources), module placement. 3) Physical-level design automation: droplet routing, defect tolerance, chip-level design, and design of pin-constrained biochips. 4) Testing and design-for-testability: Defects, fault modeling, test planning, reconfiguration techniques, sensor integration and cyberphysical system design.","","978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0712","10.1145/2039370.2039430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062311","Microfluidics;biochips;system-on-chip;design automation","Microfluidics;Medical services;Tutorials;Laboratories;Integrated circuits;Educational institutions;Biochemistry","biochemistry;bioMEMS;drops;embedded systems;health care;lab-on-a-chip;microfabrication;microfluidics;molecular biophysics;monolithic integrated circuits;nanofluidics","digital microfluidic biochips;functional diversity;cyberphysical systems;biomedical chips;embedded systems;health care;biochemistry;droplet based digital microfluidics;biochip devices;laboratory procedure automation;molecular biology;nanoliter volume droplet control;biochemical samples;biochemical reagents;integrated circuit technology;chemical payload;microfluidic droplets;nanofluidic droplets;chip integration;design automation tools;semiconductor IC;biochip compiler;optimized fluidic instructions;executable fluidic instructions;sensor integration;control software;cyberphysical framework;actuation methods;electrowetting;microfabrication processes;system level design automation;synthesis techniques;droplet routing;defect tolerance;chip level design;pin constrained biochip design","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fox","NA; NA","2010 IEEE/ACIS 9th International Conference on Computer and Information Science","","2010","","","477","481","Application development for mobile devices has become big business. Between the increasing computational capabilities of these devices, their ubiquity, and the availability of dozens of development environments, new applications for these devices are being produced daily by large companies and independent software entrepreneurs. As a result, many researchers are interested in the computational strength and potential of mobile devices. While benchmark tests for desktop and laptop processors are readily available, there are very few benchmarks available for the processors used in mobile devices. Rather, the data for mobile device capabilities are primarily limited to the usability of the devices, tests regarding overall features, and battery capacity. However, one of the major challenges of the on-going trend of researchers migrating computationally intensive algorithms originally designed for desktops to mobile devices is the lack of fundamental understanding of the computational capabilities of the processors of mobile devices. In order to address this significant gap in the research and to provide programmers with a better understanding of the computational capabilities and limitations of these devices, this research devised and ran a series of benchmark tests on several popular mobile phones. This paper describes the nature of the benchmark tests developed, presents the results, and highlights some of the interesting limitations which were identified in the process.","","978-1-4244-8198","10.1109/ICIS.2010.116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5590492","mobile computing capability;testing mobile prosessors;mobile processor benchmarks","Mobile handsets;Program processors;Benchmark testing;Arrays;Optimization;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation","microprocessor chips;mobile handsets","computational capabilities;mobile device processors;interesting benchmark results;mobile phones","","3","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, combining accurate network parameters' estimation and flexible lightweight measurements is an open challenge. In this context, this paper proposes a self-adaptive sampling technique, based on linear prediction, which allows to reduce significantly the measurement overhead, while assuring that sampled traffic reflects the statistical characteristics of the global traffic under analysis. The technique is multiadaptive as several parameters are considered in the dynamic configuration of the traffic selection process. The devised test scenarios aim at exploring the proposed sampling technique ability to join accurate network estimates to reduced overhead, using throughput as reference parameter. The evaluation results, obtained resorting to real traffic traces representing wired and wireless aggregated traffic scenarios and actual network services, prove that the simplicity, flexibility and self-adaptability of this technique can be successfully explored to improve network measurements efficiency over distinct traffic conditions. For optimization purposes, this paper also includes a study of the impact of varying the order of prediction, i.e., of considering different degrees of past memory in the self-adaptive estimation mechanism. The significance of the obtained results is demonstrated through statistical benchmarking.","","978-1-4673-2164-8978-0-7695-4749","10.1109/HPCC.2012.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332250","","Throughput;Estimation;Time measurement;Correlation;Accuracy;Prediction algorithms","computer network management;optimisation;parameter estimation;sampling methods;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","network measurement optimization;traffic sampling techniques;network management tasks;network parameter estimation;self-adaptive sampling technique;linear prediction;measurement overhead reduction;dynamic configuration;traffic selection process;network throughput;reference parameter;global traffic trace resorting;wired aggregated traffic scenarios;wireless aggregated traffic scenarios;network services;self-adaptive estimation mechanism;statistical benchmarking","","","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is exacerbated by the packaging of multiple devices within the same footprint based on die stacking or package stacking. In view of the thermal concerns, we conducted a comprehensive thermal study of chip stack and package stack devices at both the component and module level using 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software FLOTHERM. The component level studies are performed under JEDEC standard conditions (JESD 51-2 and JESD 51-6). The simulation results were used to obtain thermal resistance matrixes and the Linear Superposition (LSP) principle was applied to estimate the temperature rise and thermal cross talk for several power split configurations. It was found that under the investigated conditions, there is an optimum power split configuration that will result in the smallest junction temperatures even when the same total package power is applied and the value of this power is influenced by the package structure. As the key application of DRAM chip stack and package stack is for high density module, studies were performed for both chip stack and package stack devices on high density memory modules under server application environments. Under the module level environment, when the top die is active with DDR3 power application, both the dual chip stack and package stack are able to achieve maximum junction temperatures less than 85Â°C when wind speed of 4m/s is applied, without the need for external heat spreader. To optimize the thermal performance of the investigated devices, the effects of various design variations were also studied. The addition of solder balls under the die area was found to improve the thermal performance of the investigated dual stack packages. The impact of increased stacking was evaluated where the thermal performance of quad stack devices were compared to the dual stack devices. The quad stack and dual stack devices exhibited similar thermal behaviors, where the chip stack devices showed minor temperature differences within the chip stack, while the temperature differences between the different dies are larger in the package stack devices. Valuable insights on the package structure, design and thermal performance at both component and module level thus obtained are presented.","","978-1-4244-8562-8978-1-4244-8560-4978-1-4244-8561","10.1109/EPTC.2010.5702714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702714","","Electronic packaging thermal management;Stacking;Junctions;Thermal resistance;Performance evaluation;Thermal conductivity","chip scale packaging;circuit analysis computing;computational fluid dynamics;cooling;crosstalk;DRAM chips;semiconductor device packaging;thermal management (packaging);thermal resistance","module level thermal performance characterization;chip stack;package stack memory device;DRAM market;cooling;multiple device packaging;package stacking;3D computational fluid dynamics software FLOTHERM;CFD software;JEDEC standard condition;thermal resistance matrix;linear superposition principle;LSP;thermal cross talk;power split configuration;DDR3 power application;quad stack device;dual stack device","","2","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system losses and voltage profile evaluation is based on a power flow analysis for the distribution network with the representation of the distributed generators using MATPOWER software package. Cost Benefit Factor (CBF) is used to evaluate the benefits of the added DG units to the system performance. This factor combined the cost of adding new DG unit with the saving gained from total power losses reduction and reserved power generation.

To generate the executable code, the CGRA compiler uses software pipelining technique that maps instructions in a loop body to multiple FUs (functional units) of CGRA for concurrent execution. Often, the programmer chooses to use aggressive optimization as a way to obtain highly performing executable code. For example, the programmer may turn off memory dependence check in order to suppress false dependence that would otherwise result in overly conservative, therefore poorly performing, executable code. A trouble is that it is not easy to verify correctness of the resulting executable code. In this paper, we propose a method to verify CGRA executable code and to detect memory dependence violation if there occurs such violation and to provide source code position where the violation occurs. We use the behavior of VLIW code as a reference and compare it with the behavior of CGRA code.

However, the engineering and specification of MES is a challenging, interdisciplinary process. Especially IT and production experts with different views and background have to cooperate. For successful and efficient MES software projects, misunderstandings in the specification process have to be avoided. Therefore, textual specifications need to be complemented by unambiguous graphical models, reducing the complexity by integrating interdisciplinary views and domain specific terms based on different background knowledge. Today's modeling notations focus on the detailed modeling of a certain domain specific problem area. They do not support interdisciplinary discussion adequately. To bridge this gap a novel MES Modeling Language (MES-ML) integrating all necessary views important for MES and pointing out their interdependencies has been developed. Due to its formal basis, comparable and consistent MES-models can be created for specification, standardization, testing, and documentation of MES software. In this paper, the authors present the formal basis of the modeling language and its core notation. The application of MES-ML is demonstrated taking a yogurt production as an example. Finally, the authors give some evaluation results that underline the effectiveness and efficiency of this new modeling approach with reference to four applications in industrial MES-projects in the domain of discrete and hybrid manufacturing.","1551-3203;1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2012.2186585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145656","Business process model and notation (BPMN);formal definition;graphical modeling notation;manufacturing execution systems (MES)","Production;Unified modeling language;Business;Data models;Automation;Manufacturing;Software","formal specification;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;program testing;simulation languages","formal specification framework;manufacturing execution system;production process;business process;MES specification;MES software projects;textual specification;unambiguous graphical model;domain specific terms;MES modeling language;MES-ML;MES software documentation;MES software testing;yogurt production","","25","44","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The flight system, referred to as the âSCAN Testbedâ will be launched on an HTV-3 no earlier than May of 2012 and will operate on an external pallet on the truss of the International Space Station (ISS) for up to five years. The Communications, Navigation, and Networking reConfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT) Project, developing the SCAN Testbed, will provide NASA, industry, other Government agencies, and academic partners the opportunity to develop and field communications, navigation, and networking applications in the laboratory and space environment based on reconfigurable, software defined radio platforms and the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) Architecture. Three flight qualified SDRs platforms were developed, each with verified waveforms that are compatible with NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The waveforms and the Operating Environment are compliant with NASA's software defined radio standard architecture, STRS. Each of the three flight model (FM) SDRs has a corresponding breadboard and engineering model (EM) with lower fidelity than the corresponding flight unit. Procuring, developing, and testing SDRs differs from the traditional hardware-based radio approach. Methods to develop hardware platforms need to be tailored to accommodate a âsoftwareâ application that provides functions traditionally performed in hardware. To accommodate upgrades, the platform must be specified with assumptions for broader application but still be testable and not exceed Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) expectations. Ideally, the applications (waveforms) operating on the platform should be specified separately to accommodate portability to other platforms and support multiple entities developing the platform from the application. To support future flight upgrades to the flight SDRs, development and verification platforms are necessary in addition to the flight system. This paper provides details on the approach used to procure and develop the SDR systems for CoNNeCT and provide suggestions for similar developments. Unique development approaches for each SDR were used which provides a rare opportunity to compare approaches and provide recommendations for future space missions considering the use of an SDR. Three case studies were examined. In two cases, the SDR vendor (General Dynamics and Harris) was the integrated platform and waveform provider. In these cases, the platform and waveform requirements were considered together by the vendor using high level analysis to support the division of the requirements. In the Harris SDR case, the platform and waveform specification was then integrated into a single document. This case study was for a first generation platform, which offers significant processing and reconfigurablility, but is not optimized for SWaP. This provides a test bed platform for many investigations of future capabilities, but requires additional SWaP than optimized flight radios. In the GD case, the specifications were provided separately. The GD SDR leverages existing platforms with minor changes to the Radio Frequency (RF) portions. The most significant change to the CoNNeCT GD SDR from previous platforms was the addition of a reconfigurable processor. The capability tests the next generation SDR, but offers limited capacity and reconfigurability. In the case of the JPL SDR, the platform was developed by JPL and Cincinnati Electronics. Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) provided a waveform that was developed on a ground-based development platform, and Glenn Research Center (GRC) ported the waveform to the flight platform and performed the integrated test and acceptance of the subsystem. This last case also leverages an existing platform development, and offers more capacity for reconfigurability than the second case.","1095-323X;1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1978-1-4577-0556-4978-1-4577-0555","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187147","","Field programmable gate arrays;Radio frequency;Computers;NASA;Aerospace electronics;Hardware;Modems","satellite navigation;software radio;space communication links","CoNNeCT approach;space telecommunications radio system;National Aeronautics and Space Administration;STRS-based testbed facility;flight system;SCAN testbed;HTV-3;International Space Station;ISS;communications-navigation-networking reconfigurable testbed project;field communications;STRS architecture;NASA tracking-data relay satellite system;SDR platforms;NASA software defined radio standard architecture;flight model SDR system;breadboard-engineering model;hardware-based radio approach;high level analysis;waveform specification;first generation platform;reconfigurable processor;Goddard Space Flight Center;GSFC;ground-based development platform;Glenn Research Center","","4","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning to rank is a useful tool for collaborative filtering and many other collaborative systems, which many algorithms have been proposed for dealing this issue. But feature selection methods receive little attention, despite of their importance in collaborative filtering problems: First, recommender systems always have massive data. Using all these data in learning to rank is unrealistic and impossible. Second, we discuss that not all the features are useful for a user's query. So choosing the most relevant data is necessary and useful. To amend this problem, we describe an algorithm called FBPCRank to choose the most relevant features for ranking. Our method combines two measures of good subsets of features, which not only can decrease the loss objective, but also reduce total similarity scores between any two features. We adopt forward and backward methods to choose the most relative features and use Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the similarity of two features. The experiments indicate that our method can outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms by selecting just small amounts of features.","","978-1-4577-0387-4978-1-4577-0386-7978-1-4577-0385","10.1109/CSCWD.2011.5960053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5960053","","Correlation;Greedy algorithms;Machine learning;Loss measurement;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Recommender systems","greedy algorithms;recommender systems","greedy feature selection;collaborative filtering;collaborative systems;recommender systems;FBPCRank;backward methods;forward methods;Pearson correlation coefficient","","4","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This architecture creates two different actors: (i) conceptual designers and Database Administrators (DBA). The first actor collects user requirements, chooses the relevant diagrams for designing the conceptual model (or the logical model). The DBA ensures the performance, the maintenance and the tuning of the final application. Most of the tasks performed by these two actors are complex and time consuming for a majority of companies. Recently, some academic and industry research efforts are moving towards truly zero-administration of DW by proposing tools (advisors) substituting some tasks of DBA. One of the functionalities of these tools is to propose recommendations in choosing optimization structures such as indexing, materialized views, etc. They do not guarantee robust solutions. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary economical model for DB /DW application. Instead of substituting the DBA by advisors, we propose to delegate some DBA tasks to conceptual designers like selecting optimization structures. First, we propose to connect user requirements to the conceptual model of the target application. Secondly, based on the analysis of requirements, SQL queries are identified and then used to select optimization structures.

The results obtained highlight the efficiency of the multilayer perceptron NN in model identification. Optimization of the NN requires mixing of two proprieties: the hidden layer size reduction and four-layered NN performances.

This ordinarily happens during the system design and demonstration phase of a program. In the case of aircraft or ground vehicles, there are several subsystem demonstrations, followed by a single system-level event. By the time a system or subsystem is ready for a functional demonstration of its diagnostic capability, there is already significant programmatic inertia towards achieving the next programmatic or contractual milestone. There is typically not enough available manpower, time-on-system, or even funding to test every possible fault in a given system or subsystem. Indeed, testing only the ""relevant"" faults, which the system's diagnostics have been built to address, can be a hugely time-consuming effort. Due to these constraints, diagnostic demonstrations are sometimes not conducted in a scientifically robust manner. Sometimes, certain testing techniques are used in an effort to expedite testing. These techniques include: emulating hardware faults and their detection circuitry in software, selecting only those faults which are easy to test or guaranteed to work, and choosing faults which do not significantly stress the diagnostics system. This paper describes a survey of diagnostic program managers in an attempt to characterize, and suggest remedies for, the time and budget-constrained fashion in which avionics diagnostics systems are functionally demonstrated today.","1558-4550;1088-7725;1088-7725","978-1-4244-7961-0978-1-4244-7960-3978-1-4244-7959","10.1109/AUTEST.2010.5613617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613617","Avionics diagnostics;built-in test;M-demo;verification","Circuit faults;Government;Personnel;Testing;Companies;Integrated circuit modeling","aircraft instrumentation;avionics;diagnostic expert systems","avionics diagnostic systems;diagnostic verification process;subsystem diagnostic capability;aircraft;ground vehicles;single system-level event;programmatic inertia;relevant faults;time-consuming effort;expedite testing;hardware faults;detection circuitry","","2","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Structural alignment of proteins is an important and widely performed task in the analysis of protein structures, whereby functionally and evolutionarily important segments are identified. However, structural alignment is a computationally difficult problem and a large number of heuristics introduced to solve it do not agree on their results. Consequently, there is no widely accepted solution to the structure alignment problem. In this study, we present a meta-analysis approach to generate a re-optimized, best-of-all result using the alignments generated from several popular methods. Evaluations of the methods on a large set of benchmark pairwise alignments indicate that TM-align provides superior alignments (except for RMSD), compared to other methods we have surveyed. Smolign provides smaller cores than other methods with best RMSD values. The re-optimization of the alignments using TM-align's optimization method does not alter the relative performance of the methods. Additionally, visualization approaches to delineate the relationships of the alignment methods have been performed and their results provided.","","978-1-4673-2747-3978-1-4673-2746-6978-1-4673-2745-9978-1-4673-2744","10.1109/BIBMW.2012.6470218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470218","meta-analysis;protein alignment;structure comparison;benchmark test;meta-program","Proteins;Synthetic aperture sonar;Principal component analysis;Optimization;Protein engineering;Software;Clustering algorithms","molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;optimisation;proteins","protein structural alignment;three-dimensional structure;protein molecule;biological function;protein structural analysis;heuristics;meta-analysis approach;benchmark pairwise alignments;TM-align optimization method","","1","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, dataflow-oriented models are qualified for capturing dynamic behavior due to data-dependent execution. In this work, we extend those data-dependent dataflow models to include dynamic power management (DPM) aspects of a target platform while still meeting hard timing requirements.

If we can understand these incentives and their causes, we might be able to reshape them and radically improve security.Software makers have shown a dramatic ability to strengthen their products' security given sufficient motivation.The most famous example is Microsoft's transformation over the past decade from a security laughingstock to a leader. In 2002, stung by several widely publicized vulnerabilities across its product line, the company began a major security initiative that produced lasting changes in its priorities, processes, and culture. Gone were the days of ""creating designs and code that emphasize features over security."" Yet changes like these are exceptional. Microsoft's shift was motivated by an intense level of scrutiny and withering global publicity that few firms experience, and it had the unusual luxury of responding with vast engineering resources paid for by monopoly rents.

Stochastic BEM, based on Monte-Carlo numerical simulation, is capable to simulate such impacts effectively as a method of statistical approximation. But the coefficient matrix is asymmetric full-matrix in the solution of BEM matrix equation, the computational complexity increase by N3 with the increase of boundary node number. On solving the complex large-scale three dimensions structure problem, the large computational scale has been a barrier in the application of boundary element method, especially for the Stochastic BEM computation. Grid computing is a new style of distributed computing technology after the cluster computing. Grid is a integrated environment of computing and resource, which realize sharing resource and cooperative teamwork .It can absorb various computing resources and translate the min to convenient and reliable computer power. On the campus grid platform, the single or multiple large-scale BEM computing could carry out expediently and efficiently. This paper took the case of a campus grid in Hohai university, and introduced the characteristic of grid computing and the three-layer frame of the campus grid such as resource layer, grid layer and application service layer, and the campus grid platform is a system based on two-level scheduler, respectively grid layer scheduler and resource layer scheduler, thus a two-level parallel strategy in the above two layers can be adopted for the computing of stochastic BEM which has two parallel specialties in both BEM computing and Monte-Carlo method. Then the realization of stochastic BEM based on grid platform was put forward. Finally, there is a test which shows the high performance and efficiency of the two-level parallel strategy for the stochastic BEM computing on the grid platform.","","978-1-4244-9712-6978-0-7695-4335","10.1109/CSO.2011.218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5957639","grid computation;hpc;stochastic bem","Reliability;Portals;Computers;Grid computing;Monte Carlo methods;Computer architecture;Teamwork","boundary-elements methods;grid computing;mathematics computing;matrix algebra;Monte Carlo methods;software reliability;statistical analysis","stochastic BEM;reliability computing;AFOSM Method;Monte Carlo numerical simulation;statistical approximation;BEM matrix equation;grid computing;cluster computing;campus grid;resource layer;grid layer;application service layer","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Admittance, transmitting voltage response (TVR) and free field voltage sensitivity (FFVS) of cymbal transducers with different structure parameters were researched with FEM. Conclusions were drew out from results of finite element analysis (FEA) about how structure parameters affect transducer's performance.

"Does the Past Say It All? Using History to Predict Change Sets in a CMDB","S. Nadi; R. Holt; S. Mankovskii","NA; NA; NA","2010 14th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","","2010","","","97","106","To avoid unnecessary maintenance costs in large IT systems resulting from poorly planned changes, it is essential to manage and control changes to the system and to verify that all items impacted by each change are updated as needed. This paper presents a method of decision support that helps guarantee that each change set (those items to be updated in the change) contains all the software or hardware components impacted by the proposed change. Today, many IT systems are managed by a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), which can be represented as a large graph in which the nodes are configuration items (CIs), such as software applications or servers, and the edges record dependencies between these items. In this paper we present a new approach to suggesting change sets based on our conjecture that each new change set is likely to be similar to instances of previous change sets. Accordingly, if the analyst determines that CI x is in a new change set, our method essentially searches for previous change sets, stored in the CMDB, that contain x, and suggests that CIs in those sets (appropriately ranked) should be considered for inclusion in the new change set. Our model uses support and confidence measures to estimate how closely nodes x and y are related, based on how often they have appeared together in past change sets. Based on these measures, we implement a prototype that suggests likely items to an analyst who is composing a change set. Based on a history of three years of a particular industrial CMDB, and several filtering techniques, the observed recall and precision values were as high as 69.8% and 88.5% respectively.","1534-5351","978-0-7695-4321-5978-1-61284-369","10.1109/CSMR.2010.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714424","Data mining;change management;maintenance;configuration management","Software;Testing;Geographic Information Systems;History;Servers;Symmetric matrices;Prototypes","database management systems;information technology;software maintenance","maintenance costs;IT systems;configuration management database;CMDB;configuration items","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The process of network emulation involves the execution of connected instances of the software under test (called virtual nodes) in a controlled environment. In previous work, we introduced an approach to minimize the runtime of network emulation experiments based on prior known average resource requirements of virtual nodes. In this paper, we introduce NETbalance, a novel approach to runtime reduction for experiments with unknown or varying resource requirements. NETbalance migrates virtual nodes during an experiment to distribute the load evenly across the physical nodes, avoiding overloaded nodes and exploiting the idle resources on underloaded nodes for speeding up the experiment execution. We make the following contributions: First, we present an emulation architecture for efficiently supporting live migration of virtual nodes. Second, we propose a cost model for determining the runtime reduction achieved through the migration. Third, we introduce an algorithm for calculating placements that minimize the experiment runtime. Our evaluations of the NETbalance prototype show, that it is able to reduce the experiment runtime by up to 70%.","1095-2055;1095-2055","978-1-4577-0638-7978-1-4577-0637-0978-1-4577-0636","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005793","","Runtime;Emulation;Network topology;Load modeling;Topology;Optimization;Computer architecture","program testing;software performance evaluation","NETbalance;network emulation testbed;distributed application;communication protocol;live migration;software under test;runtime reduction;emulation architecture;virtual node placement","","2","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many non-linear characteristics of the generator such as value point effect, non smooth cost functions of fuel and emission and ramp rate limits are considered in this proposed method. The cost function of the generator exhibits the non convex characteristics, as the valve point effects are modeled and imposed as rectified sinusoid components. The velocity, which is popularly known as sensitive parameter of CSAPSO is adjusted dynamically in order to increase its precision. A chaotic local search operator is introduced in the proposed algorithm to avoid premature convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization is verified in simulation studies using MAT LAB software. In this proposed work, fuel cost and emission are treated as competing objectives.

Corresponding management of orders and invested assets demands for multi-level and multi-objective optimization. Software systems of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Manufacturing Execution System (MES) applications used presently in practice are based on different modeling approaches. However, most of involved mathematical models use a set of complicated production equations. In these equations, released jobs and operation rates (as input) can be considered as the most important parameters that may play the controlling role of the production. The considered mathematical models usually evaluate three key performance indices (KPIs) of great importance. These indices are as follows: 1. Readiness for delivery, 2. Stock or WIP (work-in-progress) level, 3.Utilization rate of resources. These indices can be considered as objective functions not only for manufacturing systems, but for the entire enterprise, too. Unfortunately these indices depend on each other and influence each other in an opposite way. A basic requirement of control policy is production stability.

For example, design cost and complexity constraints have recently caused the microprocessor industry to switch to multi-core architectures, even though these parallel machines present programming challenges that are far from solved. Moore's Law now translates into ever-more processors on a multi-, and soon many-core chip. The software challenge is compounded by the need for increasing fault-tolerance as near-atomic-scale variability and robustness problems bite harder. We look beyond this transitional phase to a future where the availability of processor resource is effectively unlimited and computations must be optimised for energy usage rather than load balancing, and we look to biology for examples of how such systems might work. Conventional concerns such as synchronisation and determinism are abandoned in favour of real-time operation and adapting around component failure with minimal loss of system efficacy.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-8-6978-1-61284-208-0978-3-9810801-7","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763006","","","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;parallel machines;software fault tolerance;transistors","Moores law;transistor;integrated circuit;design cost;complexity constraint;microprocessor industry;multicore architecture;parallel machine;near-atomic-scale variability;fault tolerance;synchronisation;real-time operation;biologically inspired massively parallel architecture","","1","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The positioning system can produce movements in a plan. The system is composed of two moving tables series connected and guided using leaf springs, with a pair of opposite actuators acting on each table. In the paper is presented the design, control and testing of this system. The controlling signals applied to the coils are pulse width modulation type. The control algorithm has two parts: the predictive positioning algorithm and the stability algorithm. To achieve a desired position the system use tabular data (starting and ending position) to extract command parameters (fill factors). This tabular data is obtained through several simulations using a FEM analysis. Because the position control is realized in PWM and not in DC current the transitory behavior was evaluated when is applied a PWM signal up to stabilization of the mobile armature at a position. This second step is performed using a finite difference model. The finite difference model implied at each iteration, data from FEM simulation. Because the FEM software (FEMM) can't solve finite difference equation, a software routine was build in LUA scripting program which call the FEM simulation software at each step. Due to the low mechanically stiffness another algorithm was proposed to stabilize the structure around the target point, using a linearised model. The results of the experimental test confirmed the functioning of the system and allowed to optimize the coefficients of the command algorithm.","","978-1-4244-6725-9978-1-4244-6724-2978-1-4244-6723","10.1109/AQTR.2010.5520868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5520868","","Control systems;Actuators;Pulse width modulation;Finite difference methods;Electric variables control;System testing;Springs;Coils;Space vector pulse width modulation;Prediction algorithms","coils;electromagnetic actuators;finite difference methods;finite element analysis;position control;pulse width modulation;reluctance machines;springs (mechanical);stability","positioning system control;biaxial variable reluctance electro-magnetic actuator;moving tables;leaf springs;system design;system testing;controlling signal;coil;pulse width modulation;predictive positioning algorithm;stability algorithm;starting position;ending position;command parameter;FEM analysis;transitory behavior;PWM signal;stabilization;mobile armature;finite difference model;FEM simulation;software routine;LUA scripting program","","2","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the Young modulus is of great relevance and the evaluation of this material property is important at education or at training levels. A flexible material is associated to a low Young modulus and a stiff material to a high Young modulus. So, in the first case, low loads are able to cause an elastic deformation and in the second case, higher loads are needed for inducing it. The association of tactile information to a bending test using similar specimens of different materials will provide to the user sensorial information on their Young modulus.

Such a capability benefits a broad spectrum of computer systems from embedded systems to supercomputers and is particularly useful for meeting power, performance, and resource-metering challenges in mobile computing, cloud computing, multicore computing, adaptive and dynamic compilation environments, and parallel operating systems. Some of the challenges in implementing self-aware systems are a) knowing within the system what the goals of applications are and if they are meeting them, b) deciding what actions to take to help applications meet their goals, and c) developing standard techniques that generalize and can be applied to a broad range of self-aware systems. This work presents our vision for self-aware adaptive systems and proposes enabling technologies to address these three challenges. We describe a framework called Application Heartbeats that provides a general, standardized way for applications to monitor their performance and make that information available to external observers. Then, through a study of a self-optimizing synchronization library called Smartlocks, we demonstrate a powerful technique that systems can use to determine which optimization actions to take. We show that Heartbeats can be applied naturally in the context of reinforcement learning optimization strategies as a reward signal and that, using such a strategy, Smartlocks are able to significantly improve performance of applications on an important emerging class of multicore systems called asymmetric multicores.","","978-1-4244-5889-9978-1-4244-5887-5978-1-4244-5888","10.1109/AHS.2010.5546266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546266","","Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Benchmark testing;Biomedical monitoring;Computers","embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;software libraries;software performance evaluation;system monitoring","self-aware adaptive system;self-aware computer system;environmental condition;embedded system;mobile computing;cloud computing;multicore computing;adaptive compilation environment;dynamic compilation environment;parallel operating system;Application Heartbeats;self-optimizing synchronization library;Smartlocks;reinforcement learning optimization strategy;multicore system;asymmetric multicore","","17","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While architectural enhancements have benefited applications with data locality and sequential access, random memory access still remains a cause for concern. Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the random memory access performance on multicore architectures. However, the performance evaluation models used by the existing benchmarks do not fully capture the varying types of random access behaviour arising in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a new model for evaluating the performance of random memory access that better captures the random access behaviour demonstrated by applications in practice. We use our model to evaluate the performance of two popular multicore architectures, the Cell and the GPU. We also suggest novel optimizations on these architectures that significantly boost the performance for random accesses in comparison to conventional architectures. Performance improvements on these architectures typically come at the cost of reduced productivity considering the extra programming effort involved. To address this problem, we propose libraries that incorporate these optimizations and provide innovatively designed programming interfaces that can be used by the applications to achieve good performance without loss of productivity.","1094-7256","978-1-4244-8520-8978-1-4244-8518-5978-1-4244-8519","10.1109/HIPC.2010.5713168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713168","","Libraries;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Graphics processing unit;Optimization;Instruction sets;Microprocessors","memory architecture;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation;random-access storage","performance evaluation models;random memory access;multicore architectures;memory access latencies;CPU speeds;data locality;sequential access;Cell;GPU;programming interfaces","","5","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many cases, the development does not realize the full potential of the parallel hardware. There exists an opportunity to meet the challenges in optimally mapping scientific application domains to multi-core computer systems through the use of compile-time and link-time optimization strategies.

Based on these observations, we present a novel NOP assignment to minimize NBTI effect, i.e. maximum NBTI relaxation, on the processors. Our analysis shows that NBTI degradation is more impacted by the source operands rather than instruction opcodes. Given this, we obtain the instruction, along with the operands, with minimal NBTI degradation, to be used as NOP. We also proposed two methods, software-based and hardware-based, to replace the original NOP with this maximum aging reduction NOP.

In this paper we mostly focus on a real use case to show the very low overhead of CPM both on the management of QoS requirements and on the tracking of hardware crossdependencies, which cannot be directly considered by local optimization policies.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-6-2978-1-4244-7054-9978-3-9810801-6","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456905","","Energy management;Power system management;Aggregates;Hardware;Resource management;Linux;Power generation;Embedded system;Application software;Energy consumption","device drivers;embedded systems;mobile computing;multimedia computing;optimisation;power aware computing;quality of service","constrained power management;multimedia mobile platform;embedded system;device drivers;QoS requirements;optimization policies;hardware crossdependencies","","2","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current research challenge is to design and realize radio systems that should be able to achieve a desired quality-of-service (QoS) in harsh, time-varying, coexisting industrial environments. Conventional coexistence solutions attempt to accommodate coexisting systems in a single dimension, mostly in the frequency dimension. The concept of multidimensional electromagnetic (EM) space utilization provides optimal opportunities to achieve coexistence optimized solutions. It can revolutionarily augment the shareable capacity of the resource space and provide optimal coexisting capabilities of radio systems. A software defined radio (SDR)-based cognitive radio (CR) is realized which can exploit the frequency, time, and power dimensions of the EM space to improve coexistence in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. Furthermore, a conventional hardware defined radio (HDR) and additional simulations are used to test and prove the feasibility of the triple EM space utilization. Joint results of these experiments are presented in this contribution.

The idea of this method is to calibrate the camera in order to extract precise three dimensional information from the images so that they can be used for the computer vision and similar applications which take the images acquired from the camera as an input. The image capturing process reduces the dimensions of data from three to two. The camera calibration procedure determines which light source is associated with each pixel on the resulting image. Since the camera used in the process is a complex CCD camera, errors resulting from the misaligned lenses and deformations in their structures result in more complex distortions in the acquired image. In order to associate the points in the cameras image space with the locations in a 3D world space the camera projection matrix consisting of the estimated intrinsic and extrinsic parametars is calculated. The calibration process is comprised of capturing calibration images and processing them in order to get the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. The results of the calibration are tested using the test images captured with the same camera. The calibration process was implemented using a MATLAB software package.","","978-953-233-068-7978-1-4673-2577-6978-953-233-072","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240932","calibration;CCD camera;perspective projection method;pixel error;intrinsic parametars;extrinsic parametars","Calibration;Cameras;Charge coupled devices;Lenses;Nonlinear distortion;Optimization;Computers","calibration;computer vision;deformation;feature extraction;matrix algebra;software packages;video cameras","Matlab;camera calibration toolbox;CCD digital camera;perspective projection method;information extraction;computer vision;images acquisition;image capturing proccess;misaligned lens;deformation;image distortion;3D world space;camera projection matrix;camera parameter estimation;MATLAB;software package","","7","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, it generates synthetic benchmarks in a high-level programming language (C in our case), in contrast to prior work in benchmark synthesis which generates synthetic benchmarks in assembly. Second, the synthetic benchmarks hide proprietary information from the original workloads they are built after. Hence, companies may want to distribute synthetic benchmark clones to third parties as proxies for their proprietary codes; third parties can then optimize the target system without having access to the original codes. Third, the synthetic benchmarks are shorter running than the original workloads they are modeled after, yet they are representative. In summary, the proposed framework generates small (thus quick to simulate) and representative benchmarks that can serve as proxies for other workloads without revealing proprietary information; and because the benchmarks are generated in a high-level programming language, they can be used to explore both the architecture and compiler spaces. The results obtained with our initial framework are promising. We demonstrate that we can generate synthetic proxy benchmarks for the MiBench benchmarks, and we show that they are representative across a range of machines with different instruction-set architectures, microarchitectures, and compilers and optimization levels, while being 30 times shorter running on average. We also verify using software plagiarism detection tools that the synthetic benchmark clones hide proprietary information from the original workloads.","","978-1-4244-9296-1978-1-4244-9297","10.1109/IISWC.2010.5650208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650208","","Benchmark testing;Optimization;Computer architecture;Cloning;Computer languages;Program processors;Hardware","C language;instruction sets;program compilers;software architecture","benchmark synthesis;compiler exploration;three key feature;high level programming language;synthetic benchmark;target system;proprietary information;compiler space;synthetic proxy;MiBench benchmark;instruction set architecture;microarchitecture;optimization level;software plagiarism detection tool","","12","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We design an H<sub>â</sub>controller for the receiver tracking loop based on an LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) approach. The H<sub>â</sub>controller is particularly attractive because it is a robust design in the sense that small disturbances lead to small tracking errors. Furthermore, it easily accommodates the inclusion of plant uncertainties as part of the plant model. By adding unstructured or structured perturbations to the plant model, it is possible to design controller that ensure stability robustness and performance robustness of the closed-loop system. In order to apply the H<sub>â</sub>optimal design, we first rewrite the GPS receiver tracking loop into a two-input two-output generalized plant model, and then the H<sub>â</sub>controller is design by using an LMI approach. The LMI is a convex optimization problem in which a local solution is guaranteed to be a global minimizer.

Test results on historical data show that, the built model is effective to rank customers in their likelihood of entering into a successful debt recovery repayment schedule.

The selected events are consolidated into files in onsite storage and then sent to permanent storage for subsequent analysis on the Grid. For local and full-chain tests a method to exercise the data-flow through the High Level Trigger is needed in the absence of real data. In order to test the system as much as possible under identical conditions as for data-taking, the solution would be to inject data at the input of the HLT at a minimum rate of 2 kHz. This is done via a software implementation of the trigger system which sends data to the HLT. The application has to simulate that the data it sends come from real LHCb readout-boards. Data can come from several input streams, which are selected according to probabilities or frequencies. Therefore the emulator offers runs which are not only identical data-flows coming from a sequence on tape, but physics-like pseudo-indeterministic data-flow, including lumi events and candidate b-quark events. Both simulation data and previously recorded real data can be re-played through the system in this manner. As the data rate is high (100 MB/s), care has been taken to optimize the emulator for throughput from the Storage Area Network. The emulator can be run in stand-alone mode, but even more interesting is that it can emulate any partition of LHCb in parallel with the real hardware partition. In this mode it is fully integrated into the standard run-control. The architecture, implementation, and performance results of the emulator and full tests will be presented. This emulator is a crucial part of the ongoing data-challenges in LHCb.

Independence is a key word in the verification and validation activity of such systems. Model based testing is used today in all flight control programs. Test cases are generated using qualified automated tools or manually to ensure code and requirements coverage. A new paradigm of coverage metric is developed here for the independent verification. This has been developed for control systems represented as Simulink blocks. The coverage metrics are defined as pairs of cells. One cell has a True/False discrete metric, which indicates if a particular functionality has been covered. The other cell has the continuous metric, which indicates a distance to nominal, or coverage. The efficacy of these metrics is determined by tests using mutant code. Matlab code corresponding to the model is mutated to generate several mutant files. It is shown that the test cases developed using this coverage metric bring out the errors introduced in the mutant files. It was possible to use these metrics to optimize test cases successfully using the Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology.","1095-323X;1095-323X","978-1-4244-7351-9978-1-4244-7350-2978-1-4244-7349","10.1109/AERO.2011.5747530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5747530","","Measurement;Mathematical model;Unified modeling language;Control systems;Safety;Software;Certification","aerospace control;aerospace safety;design of experiments;program testing;safety-critical software;Taguchi methods","input output based model coverage paradigm;control block;safety critical control system;flight control system;model based testing;Simulink blocks;coverage metrics;Matlab code;Taguchi design of experiment method","","2","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely used in network computing and embedded systems because it offers several key advantages such as safe programming, code verification and checking, automatic memory management, and significant support from the computing industry. As the popularity of Java has rapidly increased, research on Java application performance is continuously of interest to the research community. This paper aims to evaluate and optimize the order of Java objects in memory in order to give a good impact on Java application performance. We evaluate how the order of Java objects in memory affects cache performance, DTLB performance and Java application execution time. This work is motivated by the facts that Java programs create many objects dynamically on the heap, access and mutate them during runtime. These objects might be spread across the memory since they are not necessarily resided in adjacent memory locations. To show how the order of objects in memory affects Java application performance, we use the garbage collector, automatic memory management in Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to reorganize the order of live objects during garbage collection time. We implemented two different object ordering schemes upon the invocation of copying garbage collector: Bread First (BF) scheme and Depth First (DF) scheme. Our experiment results show that Java execution time, cache misses and DTLB misses vary by 3-16%, 5-20% and 9-21% respectively due to BF and DF schemes. We optimize the order of frequently accessed objects and the results show that this optimized scheme has a better impact on Java application performance compared with the DF scheme.","2155-6830;2155-6822;2155-6822","978-1-4577-0752-0978-1-4577-0753-7978-1-4577-0751","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021558","Java;object;performance","Java;Runtime;Memory management;Optimization;Object recognition;Benchmark testing;Virtual machining","Java;object-oriented programming;storage management;virtual machines","Java object ordering scheme;software development;Java application performance;cache performance;DTLB performance;Java application execution time;heap object;access object;mutate object;Java virtual machine;garbage collector;memory management;bread first scheme;depth first scheme","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design of Guidance and Control system for nonlinear dynamic systems is an arduous task and various approaches have been attempted in the past to address coupled system dynamics and nonlinearities. In this paper, the approach of Guidance and Control is exclusively based on fuzzy rule-based mechanism. Since fuzzy logics are more identical to human decision making so, this strategy enhances robustness and reliability in guidance and control mechanism and meet the flight objectives tactfully and manage vehicle energy. For inner loop, fuzzy rule based autopilot is designed which precisely follows the reference pitch attitude profile. The reference pitch profile is constantly reshaped online by a fuzzy rule based guidance to achieve desired altitude. Since reshaping attitude has no great influence on velocity; therefore, an engine shutoff mechanism has been implemented depending on the magnitude of semi major axis during the 3rd and final stage to gain the required orbital velocity. To design optimal fuzzy rule based control and guidance algorithm, the distribution of the membership functions of fuzzy inputs and output are obtained by solving constraint optimization problem using Genetic Algorithms (GA). To get nominal trajectory profiles for proposed scheme, offline trajectory optimization is performed primarily. To acquire optimal AOA profile, Optimization problem is solved by using Genetic Algorithm. To analyze the flight path of the vehicle, a point mass trajectory model is developed. In this model constant thrust and mass flow rate are assumed while the aerodynamic coefficients are calculated by DATCOM. For performance evaluation and validation of proposed guidance and control algorithm, a Six Degree of Freedom software is developed and simulated in SIMULINK. Numerous simulations are conducted to test the proposed scheme for a variety of disturbances and modeling uncertainties.","2164-7151;2164-7143;2164-7143","978-1-4577-1676-8978-1-4577-1676-8978-1-4577-1675","10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121651","Trajectory Optimization;Fuzzy Control;Fuzzy Guidance;Genetic Algorithms;Launch Vehicle Guidance and Control;GA","Vehicles;Trajectory;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Fuzzy systems;Niobium;Aerodynamics","aerodynamics;aerospace engines;aircraft control;attitude control;control nonlinearities;control system synthesis;decision making;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithms;nonlinear dynamical systems;uncertain systems","hybrid genetic algorithm;fuzzy rule based guidance;launch vehicle control;four stage launch vehicle;guidance system design;control system design;nonlinear dynamic system;coupled system dynamics;nonlinearities;fuzzy logics;human decision making;fuzzy rule based autopilot;reference pitch attitude profile;reshaping attitude;engine shutoff mechanism;optimal fuzzy rule based control design;membership function;constraint optimization problem;nominal trajectory profiles;offline trajectory optimization;angle-of-attack profile;flight path analysis;point mass trajectory model;constant thrust;mass flow rate;aerodynamic coefficients;DATCOM;six degree of freedom software;SIMULINK;modeling uncertainties","","7","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach involves calculation of control actions, i.e. time schedules for pumps, valves and sources, to minimize the costs associated with energy used for water pumping and treatment and water losses due to leakage, whilst satisfying all operational constraints. The process of computing the control action utilises EPAnet hydraulic simulator, a mathematical modelling language called GAMS and a non-linear programming solver called CONOPT. The proposed control scheme has been integrated with an industrial SCADA system from ABB and interfaced with an actual medium-scale water distribution systems being part of Yorkshire Water Services. The scheme is currently being tested using on-line telemetry data. It has been operational for over 1 month with 1 hour sampling time and the preliminary results described in this paper indicate a potential for savings of 30% of the cost of electrical energy.","","978-1-84600-038","10.1049/ic.2010.0416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6490874","Model predictive control;water distribution systems;pump control;SCADA;nonlinear optimisation","","control engineering computing;costing;hydraulic control equipment;nonlinear programming;predictive control;pumps;SCADA systems;specification languages;valves;water supply","online energy and leakage management;model predictive control;control action;time schedule;valve;cost minimization;water pumping;water loss;operational constraint;EPAnet hydraulic simulator;mathematical modelling language;GAMS;nonlinear programming solver;CONOPT;industrial SCADA system;ABB;medium-scale water distribution system;Yorkshire Water Services;online telemetry data;electrical energy cost","","1","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Current methods overlap greatly in terms of identifiable algorithmic components, and the impact of specific components on performance is generally unclear in important real-world scenarios involving serial scanning, multiple scanners, and neurodegenerative disease. Therefore we evaluated the impact that one such component, the Markov Random Field (MRF) optimizer that encourages spatially-smooth tissue labelings, has on brain tissue segmentation performance. Two challenging elderly data sets were used to test segmentation consistency across scanners and biological plausibility of tissue change estimates; and a simulated young brain data set was used to test accuracy against ground truth. Belief propagation (BP) and graph cuts (GC), used as the MRF optimizer component of a standardized segmentation system, provide high segmentation performance on aggregate that is competitive with end-to-end systems provided by SPM and FSL (FAST) as well as the more traditional MRF optimizer iterated conditional modes (ICM). However, the relative performance of each method varied strongly by performance criterion and differed between young and old brains. The findings emphasize the unique difficulties involved in segmenting the aging brain, and suggest that optimal algorithm components may depend in part on performance criteria.","1558-4615;1094-687X;1557-170X;1557-170X","978-1-4577-1589-1978-1-4244-4121-1978-1-4244-4122","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091925","","Image segmentation;Aging;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain models;Labeling","belief networks;biological tissues;biomedical MRI;brain;graph theory;image segmentation;iterative methods;Markov processes;medical image processing;neurophysiology","Markov random field optimizer;MRI;tissue segmentation;aging brain;image segmentation;magnetic resonance images;grey matter;white matter;cerebrospinal fluid compartments;neuroimaging;neurodegenerative disease;serial scanning;multiple scanners;spatially-smooth tissue labelings;tissue change estimates;belief propagation;graph cuts;iterated conditional modes","Aged;Aging;Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains;Software","","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The OMAN design engine works by taking a specification of network requirements and objectives, and allocates resources which satisfy the input constraints and maximize the communication performance objective. The tool is used to explore networking design options and challenges, including: power control, adaptive modulation, flow control, scheduling, mobility, uncertainty in channel models, and cross-layer design. The unaddressed niche which OMAN seeks to fill is the general framework for optimization of any network resource, under arbitrary constraints, and with any selection of multiple objectives. While simulation is an important part of measuring the effectiveness of implemented optimization techniques, the novelty and focus of OMAN is on proposing novel network design algorithms, aggregating existing approaches, and providing a general framework for a network designer to test out new proposed resource allocation methods. In this paper, we present a high-level view of the OMAN architecture, review specific mathematical models used in the network representation, and show how OMAN is used to evaluate tradeoffs in MANET design. Specifically, we cover three case studies of optimization. The first case is robust power control under uncertain channel information for a single physical layer snapshot.

The cross-layer modules were incorporated in a common software platform forming a planning and operation tool that takes into account physical-layer impairments in the decision making. The overall solution relies on a GMPLS-based control plane that was extended to disseminate the physical layer information required by the cross-layer modules. One of the key activities in DICONET concerns the routing and wavelength assignment of traffic demands that arrive dynamically during the network operation. Identifying the important role of dynamic lightpath provisioning, in this work we focused on the performance of routing algorithms in dynamic optical networks. We tested the suitability and performance of two different online IA-RWA algorithms in a 14-node experimental test-bed that employed centralized control-plane architecture under the same network and traffic conditions. The parameters used to evaluate the two routing engines included the lightpath setup time and the blocking ratio in a traffic scenario where connections arrive and depart from the network dynamically. Results for different traffic loads showed that optimum impairment-aware decisions are made at the expense of higher lightpath setup times.","","978-1-905824-25-0978-1-4577-0928-9978-1-905824-25","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095250","Networks;Optical Communications","Engines;Routing;Optical fiber networks;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Planning;Protocols","decision making;optical fibre communication;optimisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","impairment-aware RWA algorithm;GMPLS-controlled dynamic optical network;European research project;DICONET;multiplane impairment-aware solution;cost-effective core optical network;cross-layer optimization algorithm;software platform;operation tool;physical-layer impairment;decision making;GMPTS-based control plane;physical layer information;wavelength assignment;network operation;dynamic lightpath provisioning;online IA-RWA algorithm;centralized control-plane architecture;routing engine;optimum impairment-aware decision","","","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One area of such criticality is the smoothness of handovers between Access Points (APs) in 802.11 based communications. In this work, two heuristic handover algorithms based on indoor positioning are designed and tested on 802.11 based networks. The two algorithms, named âposition basedâ and âprediction basedâ utilizes a previously populated position based RSSI database to determine the optimal AP to connect at a particular location. The goal is to select the best AP at each identified location in order to optimize the performances of an application (in terms of lesser number of packets lost and to achieve the optimum throughput). To test these algorithms, we build a testing environment with an indoor based mobile factory worker. This worker utilizes a Microsoft Windows based operating environment considering the fact that a vast majority of today's mobile computing devices are run on Microsoft Windows based platforms. The indoor environment is populated with 802.11b APs which are distributed along the mobile worker's path. The performance is measured in terms of the performance of the applications run on the mobile computing device generating TCP and UDP based traffic. The results conclude that both algorithms outperform the algorithm used conventionally by the Microsoft Windows operating environment considering the maximum throughput achieved.","2151-1802;2151-1810","978-1-4244-8552-9978-1-4244-8549-9978-1-4244-8551","10.1109/ICIAFS.2010.5715652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715652","Seamless handover;mobile worker;prediction based","Wireless LAN;Prediction algorithms;Manganese;Throughput;Mobile communication;Software;Software algorithms","mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);operating systems (computers);telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","802.11 handover optimization;mobile factory worker communication;mobile computing device;access point;AP;RSSI database;Microsoft window;TCP;UDP-based traffic","","1","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When they do so, they also clone any bugs in the original code. Or, different developers may independently make the same mistake. As one example of a bug, multiple products in a product line may use a component in a similar wrong way. This paper makes two contributions. First, it presents an empirical study of cloned buggy code. In a large industrial product line, about 4% of the bugs are duplicated across more than one product or file. In three open source projects (the Linux kernel, the Git version control system, and the PostgreSQL database) we found 282, 33, and 33 duplicated bugs, respectively. Second, this paper presents a tool, CBCD, that searches for code that is semantically identical to given buggy code. CBCD tests graph isomorphism over the Program Dependency Graph (PDG) representation and uses four optimizations. We evaluated CBCD by searching for known clones of buggy code segments in the three projects and compared the results with text-based, token-based, and AST-based code clone detectors, namely Simian, CCFinder, Deckard, and CloneDR. The evaluation shows that CBCD is fast when searching for possible clones of the buggy code in a large system, and it is more precise for this purpose than the other code clone detectors.","1558-1225;0270-5257;0270-5257","978-1-4673-1067-3978-1-4673-1066-6978-1-4673-1065","10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227183","Validation;Debugging aids","Cloning;Computer bugs;Optimization;Linux;Complexity theory;Kernel;Detectors","configuration management;graph theory;Linux;operating system kernels;program debugging;public domain software;SQL","CBCD;cloned buggy code detector;industrial product line;open source projects;Linux kernel;Git version control system;PostgreSQL database;CBCD tests graph isomorphism;program dependency graph representation;PDG;buggy code segments;text-based code clone detectors;token-based code clone detectors;AST-based code clone detectors;Simian;CCFinder;Deckard;CloneDR","","27","34","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DCT-based interpolation filter (DCT-IF) is currently employed in the HEVC test model (HM) software. However, the values of the filter coefficients are constant regardless of the characteristic of the input video.

MBARI has developed an advanced AUV control system, the Teleo Reactive Executive (T-REX) that enables the vehicle to survey areas in more detail if biogeochemical markers indicate the presence of a target feature, and even to follow dynamic ocean phenomena such as fronts. T-REX uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in constraint-based temporal planning together with a layered control architecture that allows plans to be generated and executed onboard. One challenge of onboard plan synthesis and execution is that the power of the system to generate different behaviors makes it hard to test in simulation, and failures at sea are costly. We introduce a randomized Monte-Carlo method based test approach that executes hundreds of simulated missions with each mission presenting different inputs to the planner, and checks each output plan for validity. The approach sets environmental parameters to exercise T-REX's domain model, and it is fully configurable. We describe how the Monte-Carlo tester integrates with T-REX, how we have incorporated it into our testing process, and the benefits for system reliability that have resulted.

The topological model is constructed from the foundation of a error correction code, required to correct for inevitable hardware faults that will exist for a large scale quantum device. It is also a measurement based model of quantum computation, meaning that the quantum hardware is responsible only for the construction of a large, computationally universal quantum state. This quantum state is then strategically consumed, allowing for the realisation of a fully error corrected quantum algorithm. The number of physical qubits needed by the quantum hardware and the amount of time required to implement an algorithm is dictated by the manner in which this universal quantum state is consumed. In this paper we examine the problem of algorithmic optimisation in the topological lattice and introduce the required elements that will be needed when designing a classical software package to compile and implement a large scale algorithm on a topological quantum computer.","2377-5386;1081-7735;1081-7735","978-1-4673-4555-2978-0-7695-4876","10.1109/ATS.2012.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394172","Quantum Computing;Error Correction;Fault-tolerance;Classical Compiler","Lattices;Logic gates;Quantum computing;Hardware;Computational modeling;Computers;Computer architecture","optimisation;quantum computing","topological quantum computer;error correction code;hardware fault;large scale quantum device;measurement based model;physical qubits;quantum hardware;universal quantum state;software package;algorithmic optimisation;topological lattice","","3","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, neural networks are black-box models having multiple challenges/difficulties associated with training and generalization. This paper initially looks into the internal behavior of neural networks and develops a detailed interpretation of the neural network functional geometry. Based on this geometrical interpretation, a new set of variables describing neural networks is proposed as a more effective and geometrically interpretable alternative to the traditional set of network weights and biases. Then, this paper develops a new formulation for neural networks with respect to the newly defined variables; this reformulated neural network (ReNN) is equivalent to the common feedforward neural network but has a less complex error response surface. To demonstrate the learning ability of ReNN, in this paper, two training methods involving a derivative-based (a variation of backpropagation) and a derivative-free optimization algorithms are employed. Moreover, a new measure of regularization on the basis of the developed geometrical interpretation is proposed to evaluate and improve the generalization ability of neural networks. The value of the proposed geometrical interpretation, the ReNN approach, and the new regularization measure are demonstrated across multiple test problems. Results show that ReNN can be trained more effectively and efficiently compared to the common neural networks and the proposed regularization measure is an effective indicator of how a network would perform in terms of generalization.","1045-9227;1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2163169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5993545","Feedforward neural networks;generalization;geometrical interpretation;internal behavior;measure of regularization;reformulated neural network;training","Biological neural networks;Training;Nickel;Optimization;Function approximation;Neurons","feedforward neural nets;function approximation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","function approximation techniques;black box model;neural network functional geometry;geometrical interpretation;reformulated neural network;feedforward neural network;error response surface;learning ability;training method;derivative free optimization algorithm;generalization ability;ReNN approach","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Feedback;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Software Design","55","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents novel methods and compiler transformations that increase programmer productivity by enabling users of the language Chapel to provide a single code implementation that the compiler can then use to target not only conventional multiprocessors, but also high-throughput and hybrid machines. Rather than resorting to different parallel libraries or annotations for a given parallel platform, this work leverages a language that has been designed from first principles to address the challenge of programming for parallelism and locality. This also has the advantage of providing portability across different parallel architectures.

In order to escape from local optima problem, the K-means is associated to PSO, which is a meta-heuristic whose main characteristics include low computational complexity and small number of input parameters dependence.

Towards this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel technique, called MPI Accelerator or MPIActor in short, which is a transparent middleware to enhance conventional MPI libraries. The main idea is to optimize MPI routines for multicore systems by adopting threaded MPI mechanism and multicore architecture aware collectives in MPIActor. With the join of MPIActor, on one hand, all MPI processes in each node are mapped to several threads in one process. As a result, the overhead of intra-node point-to-point communications can greatly decrease. On the other hand, the collective routines are implemented by the cooperation of individual intra - and inter-node collective subroutines, and the intra-node collective subroutines can be further optimized by multicore architecture aware collective algorithms. Based on above idea, a framework involving an MPI_Reduce routine and a set of point-to-point communication routines has been implemented and evaluated on a 256 cores Nehalem platform. When compared to the performance of MVAPICH2, the final experimental results show that the performance by MPIActor can be significantly improved whatever by using OSU_LATENCY benchmark for point-to-point communications or IMB Reduce benchmark for reduction collectives. Especially, the performance results of using OSU_LATENCY benchmark even can be improved up to 321%.","","978-1-4244-8335-8978-0-7695-4214","10.1109/HPCC.2010.89","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581329","Threaded MPI;MPI Accelerator;Communication;Multicore-Architecture Adaptive Collective;MPIActor","Multicore processing;Message systems;Libraries;Algorithm design and analysis;Receivers;Instruction sets","benchmark testing;message passing;middleware;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;parallel architectures;software libraries;subroutines","MPIActor;multicore architecture adaptive;thread based MPI program accelerator;MPI foundational software;parallel software;high performance communication domain;transparent middleware;MPI library;intranode point-to-point communication;internode collective subroutine;intranode collective subroutine;MPI reduce routine;MVA PICH2;OSU LATENCY benchmark;IMB reduce benchmark","","","30","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As new modes of expression and ideas arise, humans are capable of extending the boundaries of language despite time-consuming and costly processes. Yet, the boundaries for processors are rigidly established upon manufacturing. A processor utilizing a static language such as an instruction set is unlikely to last long amongst rapidly advancing technologies, and valuable time and energy are lost due to the use of outmoded forms to express new ideas. In attempts to overcome such limitations and inefficiencies, new instructions are continuously added to the instruction set for greater adaptability to support swiftly evolving applications. Unfortunately, this process requires time-consuming and costly manufacturing, and even this level of adaptability is unsatisfactory and results in a processor that falls short of its intended potential. Since post-manufacturing instruction set customization is generally impossible, an instruction set usually comprises hundreds of instructions while only about 20% of instructions are typically used in most of applications.

The data are prepared and analyzed using the statistical software called Minitab version 16.0. The geometric parameters such as speed hump height, length and width are used to ascertain the effect of 85<sup>th</sup> percentile speed reduction. After several analyses were conducted one model with R-Sq value of 80.6% was developed using multiple linear regressions. If the model using the linear regression analysis is implemented and enhanced into current guideline and standard in Malaysia, it could play an important role in designing or redesigning the speed humps geometric in relation to the desired speed limit for residential streets in Malaysia.","","978-1-4673-4617-7978-1-4673-4615-3978-1-4673-4616","10.1109/CHUSER.2012.6504341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504341","Traffic calming;Speed hump and Hump Geometric design","","design engineering;design of experiments;optimisation;regression analysis;shapes (structures);structural engineering;velocity measurement","optimization;speed hump design;Malaysia;residential streets;speed reduction;experimental design;speed data measurement;instrumentation;Pro Laser III Laser Gun Meter Detector;statistical software;multiple linear regressions;linear regression analysis","","","27","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The programming problem is even more complex in the case of systems that utilize reconfigurable devices. The increased complexity of programming necessitates the use of tools that can support programmers in migrating existing applications to these emerging systems. Programmers need increasingly sophisticated tools for profiling and analysis of applications. Particularly, tools to inspect the memory access behavior of applications become crucial due to the processor/memory communication bottleneck. In this paper, we present xQUAD, a unique extension to the QUAD dynamic profiling toolset, which augments the memory access analysis of an application by providing detailed, fine-grained intra-function information. xQUAD provides detailed memory access information on the application source code data object granularity. This information can help programmers for application optimization and revision. We also present a ranking method based on the memory access intensity of a function, which reveals more accurately the suitability of the function for hardware implementation. xQUAD is tested on a real application from the multimedia domain to describe the capabilities of the proposed toolset.","","978-1-61284-383-4978-1-61284-380-3978-1-61284-382","10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999888","Dynamic profiling;Instrumentation;Performance analysis;Code tuning;Reconfigurable architectures;Hardware/Software partitioning","Instruments;Debugging;Hardware;Data mining;Kernel;Runtime;Data structures","inspection;program debugging;software tools;storage management;systems analysis","runtime extraction;memory access information;application source code;processing elements;multiprocessor system;programming problem;reconfigurable device;application profiling;application analysis;memory access behavior inspection;processor-memory communication bottleneck;xQUAD;QUAD dynamic profiling toolset;application optimization;application revision;ranking method;memory access intensity;hardware implementation;multimedia domain;DWARF debugging","","1","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Solution for Fault-Tolerance Based on Adaptive Replication in MonALISA","A. Costan; M. I. Andreica; V. Cristea; C.

Together with the extension of the application domains, new requirements have emerged for large-scale distributed systems. Among these, fault tolerance is needed by more and more modern distributed applications, not only by the critical ones. In this paper we present a solution aiming at fault tolerant monitoring of the distributed systems within the MonALISA framework. Our approach uses replication and guarantees that all processing replicas achieve state consistency, both in the absence of failures and after failure recovery. We achieve consistency in the former case by implementing a module that ensures that the order of monitoring tuples is the same at all the replicas. To achieve consistency after failure recovery, we rely on check pointing techniques. We address the optimization problem of the replication architecture by dynamically monitoring and estimating inter-replica link throughputs and real-time replica status. We demonstrate the strengths of our solution using the MonALISA monitoring application in a distributed environment. Our tests show that the proposed approach outperforms previous solutions in terms of latency and that it uses system resources efficiently by carefully updating replicas, while keeping overhead very low.","","978-1-4244-8538-3978-0-7695-4237","10.1109/3PGCIC.2010.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662762","fault tolerance;replication;monitoring;distributed systems;Grid computing","Monitoring;Computer architecture;Distributed databases;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Availability","distributed processing;optimisation;software architecture;software fault tolerance","fault-tolerance;adaptive replication;MonALISA;large-scale distributed systems;fault tolerant monitoring;failure recovery;optimization problem;replication architecture;inter-replica link throughputs;real-time replica status","","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a program and its correctness specification, scope-bounded checking encodes control-flow and data-flow of bounded code segments into declarative formulas and uses constraint solvers to search for correctness violations. For non-trivial programs, the formulas are often complex and represent a heavy workload that can choke the solvers. To scale scope-bounded checking, our previous work introduced an incremental approach that uses the program's control-flow as a basis of partitioning the program and generating several sub-formulas, which represent simpler problem instances for the underlying solvers. This paper introduces a new approach that uses the program's dataflow, specifically variable-definitions, as a basis for incremental checking. Experimental results show that the use of data-flow provides a significant reduction in the number of variables in the encoded formulas over the previous control-flow-based approach, thereby further improving scalability of scopebounded checking.","1071-9458;1071-9458;2332-6549","978-1-4244-9056-1978-0-7695-4255","10.1109/ISSRE.2010.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635077","Scope-bounded checking;Alloy;first-order logic;SAT;lightweight formal method;computation graph;white-box testing;data-flow analysis;JML","Complexity theory;Metals;Encoding;Scalability;Java;Semantics;Engines","data flow analysis;program verification;search problems","incremental scope bounded checking;data flow analysis;relational constraint solver;correctness specification;control flow;bounded code segment","","5","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is important to develop a rapid method for mapping farmland organic matter at county scale using remote sensing technology. The HJ-1A HSI image used in the paper has 115 bands, which result in good response to soil organic matter. With the support of in-situ sample data, the correlation between organic matter and characteristic variants of HSI image was analyzed. Then the optimized response wavebands and feature algorithm was selected. Through the application of multiple linear regressions, the model of retrieving farmland organic matter at a county scale was developed. Results indicated that the visible and near infrared bands of HSI image, especially 540-860 nm bands, had good response to farmland organic matter. The model of first order differential logarithm of HSI reflectivity could reach best accuracy, of which the determination coefficients (R) of training and testing samples were both higher than 0.7, while the RMSEs all around 0.2%.

P2PDC is devoted to task parallel applications like numerical simulation problems or optimization problems solved via parallel or distributed iterative algorithms. For distributed applications meant to run with P2PDC, a performance prediction tool named dPerf was proposed. dPerf combines static and dynamic analysis with trace-based simulation to provide scientist with information about the execution of their large scale numerical simulation applications. dPerf addresses real parallel and distributed numerical simulation and optimisation applications written in C, C++ or Fortran for P2PDC. This paper introduces an enhancement of the dPerf tool which provides scalable performance prediction results. Scaling is done with respect to (i) network configuration and (ii) number of peers. Scaling predictions based on network configuration is achieved through trace-based simulation, where various architectures can be studied. Scaling predictions based on the number of peers implies analyzing the communication topology and modifying trace files prior to simulation.

The basic idea of the software is to enable information retrieval by simply looking inside a 3D environment, since moving and looking in the real world are basic interactions, which all viewers use. It ranks the relevant information by means of its position/orientation of the viewer in 3D space. The ranking algorithm that we developed matches the intuitive expectation of users as verified by means of formal usability tests. We present its application in the project in progress for the Museum of the sculpture in the Basilica of St. Silvestro at the Catacombs of Priscilla in Rome, where the user will be able to retrieve information through the virtual visit and using QR-code in situ for each fragment of sarcophagi. An important aspect with internet usage is the optimisation of the 3D model. This has been achieved creating a low poly 3D mesh with the application of normal and displacement maps generated with a baking process of the high poly 3D model. In this way we have optimized for the Web and the interactive use. To reduce the chromatic aberration a massive photographic campaign was used to texturize the 3D model through a camera matching process. The result is a low poly 3D model fully texturized ready to use and imported in many 3D viewers. Normally we use the Unity 3D technology (http://unity3d.com) to visualize and interactively navigate 3D models. The Unity plug-in is available for all the major browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari) and platforms (Windows, OsX). Our interdisciplinary collaboration is a contribute to try an innovative solution for the accessing and managing the information in its context.","","978-1-4673-2564-6978-1-4673-2563","10.1109/VSMM.2012.6365953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365953","web-based visualization;sarcophagi;relevant information;catacomb;3D Gaussian","Solid modeling;Context;Cultural differences;Software;Navigation;Educational institutions;Internet","cameras;data visualisation;image matching;Internet;mesh generation;museums;online front-ends;relevance feedback;solid modelling;SQL;virtual reality;visual databases","virtual museum browsing;interactive 3D environment visualisation;Web information access;content management tool;Internet Explorer;Web browsers;MySQL;information database;3D space viewer orientation;ranking algorithm;formal usability tests;sculpture;Priscilla catacomb;St. Silvestro basilica;Rome;virtual visit;QR-code;Internet usage;3D model optimisation;low poly 3D mesh creation;displacement maps;baking process;high poly 3D model;chromatic aberration reduction;camera matching process;Unity 3D technology;interactive 3D model navigation;Unity plug-in;information management;relevant information retrieval","","1","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A hardware/software co-design model for face recognition using Cognimem Neural Network chip","S. Sardar; G. Tewari; K. A.

Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) have proven effective approach for face recognition. Software implementations fail to capture the inherent parallelism of RBFN and incur long training time. Although, hardware implementations can speed up the training process, they may lead to inflexible solution. The main challenges of Face Recognition today are broad lightning variations, handling rotation in depth, together with personal appearance changes. A highly accurate face recognition system requires a number of complex sub-operations to be performed. To balance the flexibility of the involved sub-modules and to achieve high accuracy in face recognition, we propose an embedded computing system, consisting of a processor and dedicated fully parallelized Cognimem Neural Network chip based board. We will also identify the optimized algorithm for each of the involved sub-operations. Results obtained after testing our proposed system, with standard databases, show promising performances in terms of Recognition accuracy, False acceptance rate (FAR), False rejection rate (FRR), training time and testing time.","","978-1-61284-861-7978-1-61284-859-4978-1-61284-860","10.1109/ICIIP.2011.6108866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6108866","Radial basis function Networks (RBFN);Cognimem Neural Network chip;accuracy;FAR;FRR","Face;Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Neurons;Databases;Accuracy;Training","discrete wavelet transforms;embedded systems;face recognition;hardware-software codesign;image classification;principal component analysis;radial basis function networks","hardware-software co-design model;Cognimem neural network chip;automated face recognition;radial basis function networks;embedded computing system;recognition accuracy;false acceptance rate;false rejection rate;PCA method;ANN classifier;DWT","","12","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the age of pervasive access to wireless digital communication, distributed biosignal interpretation networks may not only optimally solve difficult medical cases, but also adapt the data acquisition, interpretation, and transmission to the variable patient's status and availability of technical resources. The background of such adaptivity is the innovative use of results from the automatic ECG analysis to the seamless remote modification of the interpreting software. Since the medical relevance of issued diagnostic data depends on the patient's status, the interpretation adaptivity implies the flexibility of report content and frequency. Proposed solutions are based on the research on human experts behavior, procedures reliability, and usage statistics. Despite the limited scale of our prototype client-server application, the tests yielded very promising results: the transmission channel occupation was reduced by 2.6 to 5.6 times comparing to the rigid reporting mode and the improvement of the remotely computed diagnostic outcome was achieved in case of over 80% of software adaptation attempts.","1089-7771;1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2038151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373927","Distributed systems;e-health;home care;pervasive ECG monitoring;ubiquitous computing","Electrocardiography;Medical diagnostic imaging;Surveillance;Wireless communication;Digital communication;Data acquisition;Availability;Frequency;Humans;Statistics","biomedical telemetry;client-server systems;electrocardiography;health care;medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","distributed ECG interpretation autoadaptivity;distributed ECG interpretation optimisation;distributed surveillance network;distributed biosignal interpretation networks;automatic ECG analysis;diagnostic data;report content flexibility;report frequency flexibility;human experts behavior;procedure reliability;usage statistics;client-server application;transmission channel occupation;remotely computed diagnostics;wireless digital communication;electrocardiography","Algorithms;Diagnosis;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Software;Telemedicine;Telemetry","4","35","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This feature is a major productivity enhancement and, more importantly, can ensure correct-by-design software provided that the code generator is provably correct. This paper presents an improvement of code generation technology for SR obtained via a novel algorithm for optimizing the multitask implementation of Simulink models on single-processor platforms with limited availability of memory. Existing code generation tools require the addition of zero-order hold (ZOH) blocks, and therefore additional memory, and possibly also additional functional delays whenever there is a rate transition in the computation and communication flow. Our algorithm leverages a novel efficient encoding of the scheduling feasibility region to find the task implementation of function blocks with minimum additional functional delays within timing and memory constraints. The algorithm is applied to an automotive case study with tens of function blocks and very high utilization to test its applicability to complex systems.","1551-3203;1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2010.2072511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582169","Code generation;mixed-integer linear programming (MILP);real-time programming;Simulink;schedulability;software models","Delay;Computational modeling;Multitasking;Real time systems;Mixed integer linear programming;Random access memory;Embedded systems","aerospace industry;automobile industry;embedded systems;program compilers;software engineering","embedded control systems;synchronous reactive model;correct-by-design software;code generation technology;zero-order hold blocks;multitask implementation synthesis;Simulink models;functional delays;software development;automotive industry;aeronautic industry","","32","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In contrast to theoretical insights from analytical studies, our study is based on actual implementation in software, incurring the actual messaging and computational overheads for both conservative and optimistic synchronization approaches of PDES. Complex and counter-intuitive effects are uncovered and analyzed, with different event timestamp distributions and available levels of concurrency in the synthetic benchmark models.

Many forms of uncertainty affect the MOP, including uncertainty in the decision variables, parameters or objectives. A source of uncertainty that is not studied in the evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) literature is the decision-maker's attitude to risk (DMAR) even though it has great significance in real-world applications. Often the decision-makers change over the course of the decision-making process and thus, some relevant information about preferences of future decision-makers is unknown at the time a decision is made. This poses a major risk to organizations because a new decision-maker may simply reject a decision that has been made previously. When an EMO technique attempts to generate the set of nondominated solutions for a problem, then DMAR-related uncertainty needs to be reduced. Solutions generated by an EMO technique should be robust against perturbations caused by the DMAR. In this paper, we focus on the DMAR as a source of uncertainty and present two new types of robustness in MOP. In the first type, dominance robustness (DR), the robust Pareto solutions are those which, if perturbed, would have a high chance to move to another Pareto solution. In the second type, preference robustness (PR), the robust Pareto solutions are those that are close to each other in configuration space. Dominance robustness captures the ability of a solution to move along the Pareto optimal front under some perturbative variation in the decision space, while PR captures the ability of a solution to produce a smooth transition (in the decision variable space) to its neighbors (defined in the objective space). We propose methods to quantify these robustness concepts, modify existing EMO techniques to capture robustness against the DMAR, and present test problems to examine both DR and PR.","1089-778X;1089-778X;1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557781","Decision making;evolutionary;multi-objective;risk;robustness","Robustness;Uncertainty;Optimization;Noise;Decision making;Organizations;Biological system modeling","decision making;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;risk management","decision-maker attitude-to-risk;conflicting objectives;evolutionary multiobjective optimization problems;Pareto set;decision variables;decision-making process;EMO technique;DMAR-related uncertainty;dominance robustness;robust Pareto solutions;preference robustness;configuration space","","13","54","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Influenza is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract. In Indonesia, numerous number of Avian-Influenza (H5N1) cases occurred in rural area, such as cases in Garut, Jawa Barat in 2006 which started in Cikelet district causing 14 infected-cases and 5 death-cases and has put Garut in an emergency situation until 2010. The H5N1 detection in rural area requires fast yet accurate diagnosis result to enable immediate curative actions. The most accurate result is provided by RT-PCR (Reverse-Transcription Polymerase-Chain-Reaction), which is high investment, and usually locates in urban area. Another diagnostic tool, rapid diagnostic test, is most common tool but gives inaccurate result because of its low sensitivity and specificity. In case of Tuberculosis, Indonesia ranks number 3, after India and China, as a country with most number of infected-people. Symptoms are chronic-cough with blood-tinged-sputum, fever, night-sweats and weight-loss. Tuberculosis is diagnosed by identifying Mycobacterium-tuberculosis organism in clinical sample. When this is not possible, probable diagnosis may be made using imaging X-rays or scans, tuberculin skin test and/or Interferon-Gamma-Release-Assay (IGRA). The main problem with tuberculosis diagnosis is difficulty in culturing this slow-growing organism in laboratory, which may take 4 to 12 weeks for blood or sputum-culture. The requirement is to create a first-hand diagnostic tool which allows paramedic mobility to rural areas for Influenza/Tuberculosis diagnostic purposes. The study first introduces lung auscultation method, then analysis and preliminary design of lung diseases diagnosis software.

This study introduces a novel Bezier curve-based generic shape encoder (BCGSE) that partitions an object contour into contiguous segments based upon its cornerity, before generating the CP for each segment using relevant shape curvature information. In addition, although CP encoding has generally been ignored, BCGSE embeds an efficient vertex-based encoding strategy exploiting the latent equidistance between consecutive CP. A non-linear optimisation technique is also presented to enable the encoder is automatically adapt to bit-rate constraints. The performance of the BCGSE framework has been rigorously tested on a variety of diverse arbitrary shapes from both a distortion and requisite bit-rate perspective, with qualitative and quantitative results corroborating its superiority over existing shape descriptors.","1751-9659;1751-9667","","10.1049/iet-ipr.2008.0128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440741","","","curve fitting;encoding;object recognition;shape recognition","Bezier curve-based generic shape encoder;object contour;shape curvature information;vertex-based encoding strategy;non-linear optimisation technique;bit-rate constraints;diverse arbitrary shapes;shape descriptors;object shape representation;control point encoding","","2","","","","","","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The proposed approach requires not only generating inventories of acquiring organizations' equipment and software products, and clear and detailed descriptions of every link in the supply chain, but also the identification of common components and their sources. This information is required not only for manufacturer and OEM supply chains, but also for the services supply chains of maintenance and repair organizations. When such critical components and services have been identified, one must prioritize their importance and apply appropriate security and testing. Such an identification and tracking system is only as good as its ability to incorporate up-to-the-minute changes and additions. This requires extensive real-time reporting and information sharing. The author presents a general description of a proprietary tool that facilitates the collaboration needed for such an approach to be effective.","","978-1-4244-6048-9978-1-4244-6047-2978-1-4244-6046","10.1109/THS.2010.5654970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654970","supply chain;dependencies;complexity;risk mitigation;common points of failure;IT outsourcing;computer hardware;computer software","Supply chains;Software;Complexity theory;Security;Organizations;Hardware;Testing","information technology;production engineering computing;risk management;supply chain management","unrecognized commonalities;information technology supply chains;plague commonly-used system;network hardware;network software;OEM supply chains;repair organizations;tracking system;identification system;information sharing","","1","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"POSS<sup>Â®</sup>: Railway Condition Monitoring developed by a maintainer","F. R. Redeker","Strukton Rail, Netherlands","5th IET Conference on Railway Condition Monitoring and Non-Destructive Testing (RCM 2011)","","2011","","","1","5","Railway Condition Monitoring (RCM) can be a great tool to improve the availability of your railways and lower the maintenance costs. Key factor for success of RCM is the implementation of the system in the organisation and the appreciation of the system by the users. This is where the POSS<sup>Â®</sup>philosophy distinguishes itself by its special approach. The hardware design focuses on simplicity and reliability. The software focuses on user friendliness for all layers in the maintenance organisation. For the implementation of RCM Strukton Rail has a large number of experienced maintenance engineers, able to advise the management, to train the users and to avoid the usual pitfalls. Important also is the selection of assets to be monitored. RCM can only pay itself back when it contributes significantly to a higher availability or an optimised maintenance process. The development of POSS<sup>Â®</sup>started in 1999 with Point Condition Monitoring which is still the most import RCM item. All experience acquired over the last 12 years is used in the design of the newest MicroPOSS data loggers that can handle any type of point drive on the market. The new software release 6.0 offers a further improved alarm generation. Other POSS<sup>Â®</sup>applications include monitoring of: track circuits, wheel shunt, level crossings, expansion joints, rail temperature and rolling stock. A new concept is the monitoring of axle loads and wheel defect detection. The required maintenance activities on a railway line strongly depend on the axle load and the wheel defects of the passing trains. The new concept gives more transparency to the infra manager and can help to optimize the maintenance of the rolling stock. The new trend on railways to use more axle counters has led to the decision of the development of POSS8","","978-1-84919-558","10.1049/cp.2011.0590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6191858","","","condition monitoring;data loggers;human computer interaction;maintenance engineering;railway engineering;rolling","railway condition monitoring;maintenance costs;RCM success;organisation system;hardware design;user friendliness;maintenance organisation;RCM Strukton rail;experienced maintenance engineers;users training;point condition monitoring;MicroPOSS data loggers;software release 6.0;alarm generation;track circuits;wheel shunt;level crossings;expansion joints;rail temperature;rolling stock;axle loads monitoring;wheel defect detection;infra manager transparency;POSS broken rail detection development;track circuits;POSS management tool","","","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Recently, powerful multi-mode wireless terminal, which is suitable for multi-service situation, has become the test product. The mobility management (MM) issues, especially handover, of different interfaces in the test product are resolved independently with a network layer solution FMIPv6. The packet loss of FMIPv6 could become an MM bottleneck. A potential approach of improving packet loss performance jointly between interfaces in multi-service scenario exists in our research. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel scheme using IEEE 802.21 MIH services to improve packet loss performance by utilizing the active links to maintain the data flow. The MIH services, Link_Action and MIH_Link_Action, are extended and an MIH event named Link_PDU_Receive_Status is added. A complete message exchange in handover procedure is provided. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme performs better in terms of packet loss comparing with the traditional independent FMIPv6 scheme.","1550-2252;1550-2252","978-1-4244-2518-1978-1-4244-2519","10.1109/VETECS.2010.5494040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5494040","","Rats;Wireless LAN;Mobile radio mobility management;Testing;Performance loss;Application software;Satellite broadcasting;Ground penetrating radar;Costs;Land mobile radio cellular systems","IP networks;mobility management (mobile radio);radio access networks","optimized handover scheme;IEEE 802.21 MIH service;multiservice environment;multimode wireless terminal;mobility management;network layer solution;FMIPv6;packet loss performance;Link_Action;MIH_Link_Action;Link_PDU_Receive_Status;radio access technologies","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Of these three components, implementing an effective parallel I/O solution has often been overlooked by application scientists and has typically been added to large scale simulations only when existing serial techniques have failed. As scientists' teams scaled their codes to run on hundreds of processors, it was common to call on an I/O expert to implement a set of more scalable I/O routines. These routines were easily separated from the calculations and communication, and in many cases, an I/O kernel was derived from the application which could be used for testing I/O performance independent of the application. These I/O kernels developed a life of their own used as a broad measure for comparing different I/O techniques. Unfortunately, as years passed and computation and communication changes required changes to the I/O, the separate I/O kernel used for benchmarking remained static, no longer providing an accurate indicator of the I/O performance of the simulation, and making I/O research less relevant for the application scientists. In this paper we describe a new approach to this problem where I/O kernels are replaced with skeletal I/O applications that are automatically generated from an abstract set of simulation I/O parameters. We realize this abstraction by leveraging the ADIOS [1] middleware's XML I/O specification with additional runtime parameters. Skeletal applications offer all of the benefits of I/O kernels including allowing I/O optimizations to focus on useful I/O patterns. Moreover, since they are automatically generated, it is easy to produce an updated I/O skeleton whenever the simulation's I/O changes. In this paper we analyze the performance of automatically generated I/O skeletal applications for the S3D and GTS codes. We show that these skeletal applications achieve performance comparable to that of the production applications. We wrap up the paper with a discussion of future changes to make the skeletal application better approximate the actual I/O performed in the simulation.","","978-1-4673-0026-1978-0-7695-4598","10.1109/eScienceW.2011.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130712","","XML;Kernel;Arrays;Benchmark testing;Educational institutions;Reactive power;Hardware","input-output programs;parallel processing","Skel;generative software;producing skeletal I/O applications;parallel computations;parallel I/O solution;I/O routines;skeletal I/O applications;XML I/O specification;I/O optimizations;I/O patterns","","4","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

System monitoring provides effective and reliable means for problem detection. Coupled with automated ticket creation, it ensures that a degradation of the vital signs, defined by acceptable thresholds or monitoring conditions, is flagged as a problem candidate and sent to supporting personnel as an incident ticket. This paper describes a novel methodology and a system for minimizing non-actionable tickets while preserving all tickets which require corrective action. Our proposed method defines monitoring conditions and the optimal corresponding delay times based on an off-line analysis of historical alerts and the matching incident tickets.

These compilers or frameworks implement one general SC protocol and then require the programmer to implement the function he wants the protocol to compute. Performance remains a challenge for this approach and it has been realized early on that special protocols for important problems can deliver superior performance. In this paper we propose a new intermediate language (L1) for optimizing SC compilers which enables efficient implementation of special protocols potentially mixing several general SC protocols. We show by three case studies - one for computation of the median, one for weighted average, one for division - that special protocols and mixed-protocol implementations in our language L1 can lead to superior performance.

The process for obtaining the coefficients is carried out in three steps. First, an evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is applied, in order to produce an RBF neural network (RBFNN) with a reduced number of RBF transformations and the simplest structure possible. Then, the initial attribute space (or, as commonly known as in logistic regression literature, the covariate space) is transformed by adding the nonlinear transformations of the input variables given by the RBFs of the best individual in the final generation. Finally, a maximum likelihood optimization method determines the coefficients associated with a multilogistic regression model built in this augmented covariate space. In this final step, two different multilogistic regression algorithms are applied: one considers all initial and RBF covariates (multilogistic initial-RBF regression) and the other one incrementally constructs the model and applies cross validation, resulting in an automatic covariate selection [simplelogistic initial-RBF regression (SLIRBF)]. Both methods include a regularization parameter, which has been also optimized. The methodology proposed is tested using 18 benchmark classification problems from well-known machine learning problems and two real agronomical problems.

The SLIRBF models are found to be competitive when compared with the corresponding multilogistic regression methods and the RBFEP method.

The university course timetabling problem involves assigning a given number of events to a limited number of timeslots and rooms under a given set of constraints; the objective is to satisfy the hard constraints and minimize the violation of soft constraints. In this paper, a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed. DE algorithm relies on the mutation operation to reduce the convergence time while reducing the penalty cost of solution. The proposed algorithm is tested over eleven benchmark datasets (representing one large, five medium and five small problems).

Change impact analysis is a well-studied methodology for finding faults in evolving systems. For example, in order to help developers identify failure-inducing edits, Chianti extracts program edits as atomic changes between different program versions, selects affected tests, and determines a subset of those changes that might induce test failures. However, identifying real regression faults is challenging for developers since the number of affecting changes related to each test failure may still be too large for manual inspection. This paper presents a novel approach FAULTTRACER which ranks program edits in order to reduce developers' effort in manually inspecting all affecting changes. FAULTTRACER adapts spectrum-based fault localization techniques and applies them in tandem with an enhanced change impact analysis that uses Extended Call Graphs to identify failure-inducing edits more precisely. We evaluate FAULTTRACER using 23 versions of 4 real-world Java programs from the Software Infrastructure Repository. The experimental results show that FAULTTRACER outperforms Chianti in selecting affected tests (slightly better, but handles safety problems of Chianti) as well as in determining affecting changes (with an improvement of approximately 20%). By ranking the affecting changes using spectrum-based test behavior profile, for 14 out of 22 studied failures, FAULTTRACER places a real regression fault within top 3 atomic changes, significantly reducing developers' effort in inspecting potential failure-inducing edits.","1063-6773;1063-6773","978-1-4577-0664-6978-1-4577-0663-9978-1-4577-0662","10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080769","","Electrocardiography;IEEE Potentials;Image edge detection;Debugging;Delta modulation;Inspection;Manuals","fault tolerant computing;Java","failure-inducing program edits;spectrum information;evolving systems;change impact analysis;failure-inducing edits;regression fault;FAULTTRACER;spectrum-based fault localization;extended call graphs;Java programs;software infrastructure repository;spectrum-based test behavior profile","","20","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there is much work on static scheduling approaches for workflow applications in parallel environments, little work has been done on a real-world Grid environment for industrial systems. Utility Management Systems (UMS) are executing very large numbers of workflows with very high resource requirements. Unlike the grid approach for standard scientific workflows, UMS workflows have different set of computation requirements and thereby optimization of resource usage has to be made in a different way. This paper proposes architecture for a new scheduling mechanism that dynamically executes a scheduling algorithm using near real-time feedback about current status Grid nodes. Two Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were created in order to solve scheduling problem. First ANN predicts future state of Grid based on current state and types of workflows that are currently executing. Second ANN output is optimal workflow type that should be executed. Inputs for second ANN are current state of the Grid and predicted future state (output of first ANN). Performance tests show that significant improvement of overall execution time can be achieved by this Hierarchical Artificial Neural Networks.","","978-1-4244-7984-9978-1-4244-7985-6978-1-4244-7983","10.1109/SOFA.2010.5565626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5565626","","Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Databases;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Monitoring;Job shop scheduling","grid computing;neural nets;optimisation;scheduling;workflow management software","hierarchical neural model;workflow scheduling;utility management systems;computational grid infrastructure;job scheduling;resource optimization;feedback;artificial neural networks","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SOAP-based Web services, however, introduce considerable communication overhead, and optimization must be done to enable use on the tactical level. Data compression is one such optimization, and it works well for large messages. We claim that the inherent characteristics of publish/subscribe-based Web services are such that using difference-based compression will allow effective compression also for small messages. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept mechanism called ZDiff, which we have tested on several types of military data formats.

It is necessary to avoid unacceptable consequences due to unwanted battery power failure. An early stage estimation of this duration reduces the overall risk through optimization of current consumption by switching off noncritical load ahead of delivery of power to a critical load. In order to address this issue, an online battery state of charge estimator on chip is conceived and implemented using Kalman filter. The Kalman filter estimates the true values of measurements by predicting a value, considering the estimated uncertainty of the predicted value, and then computing a weighted average of the predicted value and the measured value. The basic idea is more accurate state prediction is possible when the state predicted value is fused with sensor prediction under any uncertain disturbance. The state estimator is developed in the form of an algorithm and stored into a single chip microcontroller. It is finally used to generate an early stage warning signal against battery failure. The paper presents a methodology for creating energy aware system that would avoid sudden system failure due to power outage. The authors used a generalized state space model of the battery to estimate the effect of unobserved battery parameters for duration estimation. An experiment was conducted in this regard through discharging the battery under constant load. Subsequently the internal parameters of battery were calculated. The model was simulated through MATLAB/simulink R2008a software and efficiency was tested.

Since traditional VMM schedulers cannot handle the scheduling scenario with mixed workloads efficiently, inter-VM communication always suffers serious performance regression from scheduling competition and then reduces the performance of entire virtualized HPC system. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes an asymmetric scheduling model based on I/O behavior perception. In this mode, we schedule I/O and computing jobs under isolated cpu subsets to erase their performance interference while optimizing the inter-VM communication through short period round robin scheduling. At the same time, we characterize the runtime I/O behavior of applications at fine temporal granularity and predict their I/O load state using specific online predictor. We will replan the scheduling scheme dynamically through migrating VMs across different cpu subsets if we predict a coming I/O intensity variation and decide the system performance could benefit from this scheduling adjustment. We build a prototype based on Xen-4.1.0 virtual and preliminary test results demonstrate that our approach could efficiently promote the performance of inter-VM communication under virtualized HPC environment while reducing the computing performance degradation caused by I/O-prior scheduling.","","978-1-4673-2164-8978-0-7695-4749","10.1109/HPCC.2012.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332173","HPC;Virtualization;Cloud;Scheduling;I/O","Processor scheduling;Optimization;Benchmark testing;Virtual machining;Time frequency analysis;Dynamic scheduling;Runtime","cloud computing;input-output programs;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;processor scheduling;regression analysis;synchronisation;virtual machines;virtualisation","I-O behavior perception-based virtualized HPC system;high-intensive I-O operations;periodic interVM communication;data transfer;VMM schedulers;performance regression;scheduling competition;asymmetric scheduling model;performance interference;short period round robin scheduling;temporal granularity;I-O load state;specific online predictor;I-O intensity variation;Xen-4.1.0 virtual test;VM communication;virtualized HPC environment;I-O-prior scheduling;isolated CPU subsets","","","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because graph partitioning is an NP-complete problem, there has been much research attention focused on developing heuristics which find reasonably good approximations to optimal solutions. This study presents a Simulated Bee Colony (SBC) graph partitioning algorithm which is based on the foraging behavior of honey bees. A computer program which implemented the SBC algorithm was executed against 12 benchmark graph partitioning problems. The SBC algorithm produced partitions with better quality than the best published results for 10 of the 12 benchmark problems. The results suggest that Simulated Bee Colony algorithms are a highly effective technique for partitioning graphs in situations where partition quality is more important than real-time performance and that using SBC graph partitioning algorithms may be particularly useful in problem scenarios where the partition result is intended for reuse such as analyses of large communication graphs.","","978-1-4577-0966-1978-1-4577-0964-7978-1-4577-0965","10.1109/IRI.2011.6009581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009581","Combinatorial optimization;graph partitioning;multi-agent systems;simulated bee colony algorithm;swarm intelligence","Partitioning algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Optimization;Software algorithms;Approximation methods","computational complexity;graph theory;multi-agent systems","simulated bee colony graph partitioning algorithm;NP-complete problem;honey bees foraging behavior;SBC graph partitioning algorithms;communication graphs;multiagent systems;combinatorial optimization;swarm intelligence","","2","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While state-of-the-art instruction set simulators (ISS) for single-core machines reach or exceed the performance levels of speed-optimised silicon implementations of embedded processors, the same does not hold for multi-core simulators where large performance penalties are to be paid.

We have evaluated our parallel simulation methodology against the industry standard Splash-2 and EEMBC MULTIBENCH benchmarks and demonstrate simulation speeds up to 25,307 Mips on a 32-core Ã86 host machine for as many as 2048 target processors whilst exhibiting minimal and near constant overhead.","","978-1-4577-0801-5978-1-4577-0802","10.1109/SAMOS.2011.6045461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045461","","Program processors;Multicore processing;Random access memory;Hardware;Computational modeling;Field programmable gate arrays;Benchmark testing","embedded systems;general purpose computers;instruction sets;just-in-time;multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;software engineering","scalable multicore simulation;parallel dynamic binary translation;multicore processors;embedded systems;general-purpose computing;large-scale data centres;parallel software development;instruction set simulators;just-in-time;JIT;DBT;ARCompact;instruction set architecture;ISA","","7","41","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we discuss the 65nm DSP subsystem which provides a power optimized DSP subsystem for dual-core software development and SoC prototyping.

These transient faults result in data flow errors or control flow errors during program running. The present software implemented hardware fault tolerant technology mainly uses the signature analysis method to realize the control flow checking, namely, through assigning signature for each basic block and inserting some instructions into every basic block to realize the control flow checking. Because the size of different basic blocks in one program usually exist obvious difference, applying unified checking method for these basic blocks will reduce the protection efficiency. To solve this problem, this paper has proposed a control flow checking optimization method named RCFG by reconstructing control flow graph. RCFG firstly merges basic blocks into larger logic blocks, then cuts the logic blocks into basic logic blocks with similar size. At last, control flow detection algorithm can be applied based on the control flow graph composed with the basic logic blocks. RCFG can effectively improve the protection efficiency of algorithm, and user can regulate the balance between performance and reliability by configuring the size of basic logic block. This paper has finished the fault injection experiment for a typical signature analysis algorithm named CFCSS. According to the experiment result, compared with the original CFCSS algorithm, the average performance expense of the CFCSS algorithm implemented based on RCFG increased by 16.6%, and the average memory expense increased by 13.5%, but the number of the faults resulting in the program outputting wrong result reduced by 47.67% equally.","","978-1-4244-6789-1978-1-4244-6788-4978-1-4244-6787","10.1109/PIC.2010.5687403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687403","control flow errors;logic block;basic logic block;fault injection","Lead;Aerospace electronics","cosmic rays;data flow analysis;data flow graphs;fault tolerant computing;logic testing;optimisation","control flow graph reconstruction;control flow checking;space radiation environment;cosmic rays;transient faults;on-board computer;data flow errors;hardware fault tolerant technology;signature analysis method;control flow detection algorithm;fault injection;CFCSS algorithm","","2","12","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An optimized scheme for entropy encoding part of JPEG image compression by modifying the run length encoding method has been provided by the authors for a Space Research Program at Institute of Space technology (IST). The same has been observed to produce a large amount of saving in terms of memory required for Biomedical compressed images. In JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image compression algorithm run length coding performs the actual compression by removing the redundancy from transformed and quantized image data. Using the fact that the preceding processes of run length coding produces a large number of zeros the original run length coding uses an ordered pair (a, b), where `a' is the length of consecutive zeros preceding the ASCII character `b'. The proposed run length encoding scheme removes the unintended redundancy by using an ordered pair only when a zero occurs. The proposed encoding scheme does not alter the PSNR value for the algorithm. Using Matlab simulation, the proposed scheme has been tested on various biomedical images over a range of quantization (quality) factor and the results confirmed the effectiveness of the new run length encoding scheme in reducing the run length encoded data size and processing time delay.","","978-1-4673-3097-8978-1-4673-3094-7978-1-4673-3096","10.1109/ICOSST.2012.6472821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472821","compression;JPEG;entropy coding;run length coding;Biomedical Imaging","Image coding;Transform coding;Quantization;Discrete cosine transforms;Algorithm design and analysis;Biomedical imaging;Compression algorithms","data compression;image coding;medical image processing;public domain software;quantisation (signal)","IST;quantized image data;transformed image data;redundancy removal;quantization factor;peak signal-to-noise ratio;PSNR value;image data quantization;Joint Photographic Experts Group;Institute of Space Technology;Space Research Program;JPEG image compression;biomedical imaging;image compression technology;storage area;temporally optimized run length coding;open source algorithm","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also extend global placement to (i) spread cells apart in congested areas, and (ii) move cells together in less-congested areas to ensure short, routable interconnects and moderate runtime. While previous work adds isolated steps to global placement, our SIMultaneous PLace-and-Route tool SimPLR integrates a layer- and via-aware global router into a leading-edge, force-directed placer.

For example, some tasks might be delayed and/or executed earlier. Some operational constraints can be introduced due to new regulations or business rules. In some cases, there might be a shift in the relative importance of objectives associated with these plans. All these potential modifications create a huge pressure on planning staff for generating plans that can adapt quickly to changes in environment during execution. In this paper, we address adaptation in dynamic environments. Many researchers in evolutionary community addressed the problem of optimization in dynamic environments. Through an overview on applying evolutionary algorithms for solving dynamic optimization problems, we classify the paper into two main categories: 1) finding/tracking optima, and 2) adaptation and we discuss their relevance for solving planning problems. Based on this discussion, we propose a computational approach to adaptation within the context of planning. This approach models the dynamic planning problem as a multiobjective optimization problem and an evolutionary mechanism is incorporated; this adapts the current solution to new situations when a change occurs. As the multiobjective model is used, the proposed approach produces a set of non-dominated solutions after each planning cycle. This set of solutions can be perceived as an information-rich data set which can be used to support the adaptation process against the effect of changes. The main question is how to exploit this set efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method based on the concept of centroids over a number of changing-time steps; at each step we obtain a set of non-dominated solutions. We carried out a case study on this proposed approach. Mission planning was used for our experiments and experimental analysis. We selected mission planning as our test environment because battlefields are always highly dynamic and uncertain and can be conveniently used to demonstrate different types of changes, especially time-varying constraints. The obtained results support the significance of our centroid-based approach.","1089-778X;1089-778X;1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2104156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095344","Adaptation;dynamic environments;evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimization","Planning;Dynamic scheduling;Vectors;Optimal scheduling;Genetic algorithms","dynamic programming;evolutionary computation;military systems;tracking","dynamic environments adaptation;mission planning;operational constraints;business rules;planning staff;evolutionary community;dynamic environments optimization;evolutionary algorithms;tracking optima;computational approach;multiobjective optimization problem;nondominated solutions;planning cycle;information-rich data set;adaptation process;changing-time steps;time-varying constraints;centroid-based approach","","18","55","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To check these hypotheses, we proposed an automatic idioms recognition method and implemented the method, based on the open source compiler Open64. With the NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) as a case study, the prototype system is about 90% accurate compared with idiom classification by a human expert. Our results showed that the above five idioms suffice to cover 100% of the six NPB codes (MG, CG, FT, BT, SP and LU).

Mei","NA; NA; NA; NA","2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","","2010","","","75","82","Infrastructure resources on-demand requires resource provision (e.g., CPU and memory) to be both sufficient and necessary, which is the most important issue and a challenge in Cloud Computing. Platform as a service (PaaS) encapsulates a layer of software that includes middleware, and even development environment, and provides them as a service for building and deploying cloud applications. In PaaS, the issue of on-demand infrastructure resource management becomes more challenging due to the thousands of cloud applications that share and compete for resources simultaneously. The fundamental solution is to integrate and coordinate the resource consumption and allocation management of a cloud application. The difficulties of such a solution in PaaS are essentially how to maximize the resource utilization of an application, and how to allocate resources to guarantee adequate resource provision for the system. In this paper, we propose an approach to managing infrastructure resources in PaaS by leveraging two adaptive control loops: the resource consumption optimization loop and the resource allocation loop. The optimization loop improves the resource utilization of a cloud application via management functions provided by the corresponding middleware layers of PaaS. The allocation loop provides or reclaims appropriate amounts of resources to/from the application system while guaranteeing its performance. The two loops are integrated to run consecutively and repeatedly to provide infrastructure resources on-demand by first trying to improve resource utilization, and then allocating more resources when necessary. We implement a framework, SmartRod, to investigate our approach. The experiment on SmartRod proves its effectiveness on infrastructure resource management.","2159-6182;2159-6190","978-1-4244-8207-8978-0-7695-4130","10.1109/CLOUD.2010.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558007","Resource Consumption and Allocation;Infrastructure Resources on-Demand;SmartRod;Integrated Control Loop;Middleware;Virtual Machine;Platform as a Service;PaaS","Resource management;Optimization;Clouds;Middleware;System performance;Monitoring;Benchmark testing","Internet;middleware;optimisation;resource allocation","resource consumption;resource allocation;infrastructure resources on-demand;platform-as-a-service;cloud computing;on-demand infrastructure resource management;PaaS service;optimization loop;middleware layers;SmartRod framework","","20","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SCJ offers, compared to the RTSJ, a simplified memory model where only the immortal and mission memory scoped areas are shared between threads and any other scoped region is thread private. In this paper we present how, due to this simplified model, a single scope nesting level can be used to check the legality of every reference assignment.

To efficiently exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies, HEVC adopts a very flexible quadtree coding structure, allowing the encoder to use a block partition better matching the image features. The best combination of HEVC block partitioning and coding modes is found by means of a rate distortion optimization process. During this minimization, the encoder tests all the possible coding modes and block partitions and keeps those providing the smallest RD cost. Due to the large number of available modes and partitions, the minimization involves extremely high complexity, which may not be suitable for real-time application scenarios. To reduce the complexity, two novel fast RDO techniques are proposed in this paper: Top Skip and Early Termination. The experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed techniques significantly reduce the encoding time, notably up to 45% regarding the high complexity HEVC reference software codec, with a negligible quality loss never larger than 0.1 dB.","","978-1-4577-2049-9978-1-4577-2047-5978-1-4577-2048","10.1109/PCS.2012.6213262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213262","","Encoding;Standards;Complexity theory;Codecs;Video coding;Force;Rate-distortion","data compression;optimisation;video coding","fast rate distortion optimization process;HEVC standard;high efficiency video coding standard;powerful coding tools;improved compression efficiency;H.264-AVC standard;spatial redundancies;flexible quad-tree coding structure;image features;smallest RD cost;block partitions;fast RDO techniques","","45","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Samhouri","NA; NA","2011 International Conference on Management and Service Science","","2011","","","1","4","Many firms have proceeded to the adoption of Enterprise Resources Planning ERP solutions to maintain competitiveness. ERP is a packaged software system that enables enterprises to integrate operations, business processes and functions through common database. However, the majority of ERP systems do not support Preventive Maintenance (PM) scheduling process. The objective of PM is to minimize equipment downtime using the limited resources of an organization. Therefore, prioritizing PM activities for equipment is essential. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based system for PM scheduling is proposed to interpret the linguistic variables extracted from expert's knowledge for determining equipment priorities, which could be incorporated as a custom module in ERP systems. The system was tested and proved to be reliable in solving PM scheduling problem.","","978-1-4244-6581-1978-1-4244-6579-8978-1-4244-6580","10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5999330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999330","","Job shop scheduling;Preventive maintenance;Availability;Fuzzy logic","enterprise resource planning;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;preventive maintenance;scheduling;software packages","fuzzy logic approach;preventive maintenance scheduling;ERP system;enterprise resources planning;packaged software system;database;equipment downtime minimization;PM scheduling problem;fuzzy inference system","","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GPUs are specifically designed for throughput and face several design challenges, specially what is known as the Power and Memory Walls. In these devices, available resources should be used to enhance performance and throughput, as the performance per watt is really high. For massively parallel applications or kernels, using the available silicon resources for power management was unproductive, as the main objective of the unit was to execute the kernel as fast as possible. However, not all the applications that are being currently ported to GPUs can make use of all the available resources, either due to data dependencies, bandwidth requirements, legacy software on new hardware, etc, reducing the performance per watt. This new scenario requires new designs and optimizations to make these GPGPU's more energy efficient. But first comes first, we should begin by analyzing the applications we are running on these processors looking for bottlenecks and opportunities to optimize for energy efficiency. In this paper we analyze some kernels taken from the CUDA SDK<sup>2</sup>in order to discover resource underutilization. Results show that this underutilization is present, and resource optimization can increase the energy efficiency of GPU-based computation. We then discuss different strategies and proposals to increase energy efficiency in future GPU designs.","","978-1-4673-0974","10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270749","Power Dissipation;Energy Efficiency;GPU;GPGPU","Graphics processing unit;Kernel;Bandwidth;Power dissipation;Benchmark testing;Clocks;Hardware","energy conservation;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;power aware computing;resource allocation;software maintenance","energy efficiency analysis;graphics processing units;parallel computing;power;memory walls;silicon resources;power management;data dependencies;bandwidth requirements;legacy software;GPGPU;CUDA SDK2;resource underutilization discovery;resource optimization;GPU-based computation","","10","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although recent research has highlighted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) as attractive platforms for high performance network virtualization, these devices remain inaccessible to the larger networking research community due to the absence of user-friendly programming models. A programming model that can abstract the intricacies of the hardware platform while being aware of the underlying resource constraints is highly desirable. In this paper, we present ReClick, a framework to efficiently design and deploy reconfigurable data planes for FPGA-based network virtualization systems. A hardware-agnostic programming model is described that allows developers to focus on the virtual data plane semantics rather than the implementation details. The framework exposes interfaces similar to the popular software router development framework, Click, and promotes design reuse. Optimization strategies are included in ReClick which use similarities between virtual data plane configurations to implement multiple planes in an area-efficient manner. Data planes exhibiting up to 1 Gbps data rate have been automatically compiled and tested in hardware in a Net FPGA platform.","","978-1-4577-1454-2978-0-7695-4521","10.1109/ANCS.2011.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062727","Network Virtualization;FPGA;Programming models;Click modular router;NetFPGA","Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Software;Programming;Hardware design languages;Computer architecture;Pipelines","computer networks;field programmable gate arrays;software reusability;virtual machines;virtualisation","ReClick;modular dataplane design framework;shared network infrastructures;field programmable gate arrays;high performance network virtualization;user-friendly programming models;reconfigurable data plane design;reconfigurable data plane deployment;FPGA-based network virtualization systems;hardware-agnostic programming model;virtual data plane semantics;Click software router development framework;software reuse;Net FPGA platform","","3","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a method for generating accurate models of components in order to solve this issue in the context of the component-based systems. The key idea of this method is to generate minimal deterministic finite automata as the accurate models of the corresponding components. For this purpose, the proposed method first computes a set of traces as a regular language of a given component by executing all possible experiments over the alphabet of the component. This method then constructs a regular expression to represent this set. After that, a minimal deterministic finite automaton as an accurate model of the component is generated by applying the Thompson algorithm and some optimized activities. The generated models are useful for the existing model-based approaches, e.g., model checking and model-based testing in improving quality of component-based software. An implemented tool supporting the method and experimental results are also presented.","","978-0-7695-4760-2978-1-4673-2171","10.1109/KSE.2012.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6299422","model generation;black-box components;Thompson algorithm;model-based approaches","Unified modeling language;Doped fiber amplifiers;Software;Automata;Modeling;Adaptation models","deterministic automata;finite automata;formal verification;object-oriented programming;software quality","model generation;black-box components;formal models;component-based systems;component alphabet;minimal deterministic finite automaton;Thompson algorithm;model-based approaches;model checking;model-based testing;component-based software quality","","","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel form of processor state fingerprinting is also presented, which can significantly reduce the fault detection latency. This further improves reliability by triggering rollback recovery before errors are recorded to a checkpoint. The mechanisms are validated using a full prototype and the benchmarks considered indicate an average performance overhead of approximately 14 percent with the possibility for significant optimization.

This work extends dynamic dataflow analyses with a novel sampling system which ensures that runtime slowdowns do not exceed a user-defined threshold. While previous sampling methods are inadequate for dataflow analyses, our technique efficiently reduces the number and size of analyzed dataflows. In doing so, it allows individual users to test large, stochastically chosen sets of a process's dataflows. Large populations can therefore, in aggregate, analyze a larger portion of the program than is possible by any single user running a complete, but slow, analysis.

Generally ATM cash management and optimization is performed manually, according to corporate policies and personnel experience. A non-optimal cash upload can lead to poor service when cash demand is underestimated and to unnecessary costs when demand is overestimated. Therefore, finding the best match between cash stock and demand becomes crucial to improve. Recently, some authors attempted to optimize the cash by modeling and forecasting the demand. However, the high variance and non-stationarity of the underlying stochastic process can affect reliability of such an approach. In this paper we suggest the application of genetic algorithms as means for searching and generating optimal upload strategies, able at the same time to minimize the daily amount of stocked money and to assure cash dispensing service.

A typical modeling example demonstrates applicability to both software and hardware scenarios and achieves simulated measurement times in the range of few hundred milliseconds.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-8-6978-1-61284-208-0978-3-9810801-7","10.1109/DATE.2011.5763182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763182","","Jitter;Phase locked loops;Bit error rate;Extrapolation;Hardware;Polynomials;Voltage-controlled oscillators","jitter;optimisation;phase locked loops","fast jitter tolerance analysis;high-speed PLL;jitter tolerance curves;high-speed phase locked loops;adaptive recursion;tail fitting;fast optimization","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, cross-layer resilient systems, which distribute the responsibility for tolerating errors, device variation, and aging across the system stack, have the potential to provide the resilience required to implement reliable, high-performance, low-power systems in future fabrication processes at significantly lower cost. These systems can implement less-frequent resilience tasks in software to save power and chip area, can tune their reliability guarantees to the needs of applications, and can use the information available at each level in the system stack to optimize performance and power consumption. In this paper, we outline an approach to cross-layer system design that describes resilience as a set of tasks that systems must perform in order to detect and tolerate errors and variation. We then present strawman examples of how this task-based design process could be used to implement general-purpose computing and SoC systems, drawing on previous work and identifying key areas for future research.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-3-9810801-6-2978-1-4244-7054-9978-3-9810801-6","10.1109/DATE.2010.5456960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456960","","Resilience;Power system reliability;Fabrication;Costs;Circuits;Error correction codes;Aging;Energy consumption;Computer architecture;Error correction","general purpose computers;logic design;optimisation;power consumption;reliability;system-on-chip","cross layer resilience design techniques;reliability;power consumption;performance optimize;strawman examples;general purpose computing;SoC systems","","31","51","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Keynote: Software engineering for a smarter planet situation-aware applications","","","2012 19th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","","2012","","","xvii","xvii","Summary form only given, as follows. The growing popularity of smart devices and applications is accelerating the convergence of the physical and the digital worlds. Smart apps allow users, with the help of sensors and networks, to do a great variety of things, from tracking their friends to controlling remote devices. At the core of such smart systems are self-adaptive systems. Self-adaptive systems optimize their own behaviour according to high-level objectives and constraints to address changes in functional and nonfunctional requirements as well as environmental conditions. Self-adaptive systems are implemented using four key technologies: runtime models, context management, feedback control theory, and run-time verification and validation. The proliferation of smart applications challenges the software engineering community in re-thinking the boundary between development time and run time and developing techniques for adapting systems at run time. The key challenge is to automate traditional software engineering, maintenance and evolution techniques to adapt and evolve systems at run time with minimal or no human interference. Hitherto, most developers did not instrument their software with sensors and effectors to observe whether requirements are satisfied in an evolving environment at run time. One way to break out of this mold is to make the four key technologies readily accessible at run time. Challenges for the reverse engineering community are to instrument existing systems with manageability endpoints (i.e., sensors and effectors), extract design time models that are useful as run-time models (e.g., to manage dynamic context), and investigate analysis techniques for run-time testing and validation (e.g., to regulate requirements).","2375-5369;1095-1350","978-0-7695-4891-3978-1-4673-4536","10.1109/WCRE.2012.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385090","Security;Reverse Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address this issue by proposing an approach that incorporates the structural similarity index as a quality metric into the framework. In particular, we develop a predictive Lagrange multiplier estimation method to resolve the chicken and egg dilemma of perceptual-based RDO and apply it to H.264 intra and inter mode decision. Given a perceptual quality level, the resulting video encoder achieves on the average 9% bit-rate reduction for intra-frame coding and 11% for inter-frame coding over the JM reference software. Subjective test further confirms that, at the same bit-rate, the proposed perceptual RDO indeed preserves image details and prevents block artifact better than traditional RDO.","1051-8215;1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2087472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5604279","H.264;lagrange multiplier;perceptual quality;rate-distortion optimization;structural similarity index;video codec","Indexes;Measurement;Encoding;Estimation;Approximation methods;Video coding;Fitting","mean square error methods;rate distortion theory;video coding","perceptual rate-distortion optimization;structural similarity index;quality metric;RDO framework;video coding;objective distortion metrics;mean squared error;predictive Lagrange multiplier estimation;chicken and egg dilemma;H.264 intra mode decision;H.264 inter mode decision;video encoder;bit-rate reduction;intraframe coding;interframe coding","","81","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to reduce the number of memory access operations, we used several techniques such as bitwidth reduction of the Gaussian parameters, multiframe computation of the emission probability, and two-stage language model pruning. We also employ a customized DRAM controller that supports various access patterns optimized for each functional unit of the speech recognizer.

With increasing numbers of programmable processor and accelerator cores per network node, it is a challenge to support sharing and synchronization across them in a way that is scalable and easy-to-program. In this paper, we focus on parallel/threaded applications that have irregular control-flow and frequently-updated shared state that must be synchronized across threads. However, conventional lock-based synchronization is both difficult to use and also often results in frequent conservative serialization of critical sections. Alternatively, we propose that Transactional memory (TM) is a good match to software packet processing: it both (i) can allow the system to optimistically exploit parallelism between the processing of packets whenever it is safe to do so, and (ii) is easy-to-use for a programmer. With the NetFPGA platform and four network packet processing applications that are threaded and share memory, we evaluate hardware support for TM (HTM) using the reconfigurable FPGA fabric. Relative to NetThreads, our two-processor four-way-multithreaded system with conventional lock-based synchronization, we find that adding HTM achieves 6%, 54% and 57% increases in packet throughput for three of four packet processing applications studied, due to reduced conservative serialization.","","978-1-4244-9127-8978-1-4503-0379","10.1145/1872007.1872053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623817","Algorithms;Design;Performance","Synchronization;Pipeline processing;Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Process control","concurrency control;field programmable gate arrays;multi-threading;shared memory systems;synchronisation","hardware transactional memory;software packet processing;network services;synchronization;parallel-threaded applications;NetFPGA platform;network packet processing applications;NetThreads","","2","49","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, this involves estimating the parameters of a dense deformation field that warps a distorted image back to its undistorted template. Generative approaches based on parameter optimization such as Lucas-Kanade can get trapped within local minima. On the other hand, discriminative approaches like Nearest-Neighbor require a large number of training samples that grows exponentially with the desired accuracy. In this work, we develop a novel data-driven iterative algorithm that combines the best of both generative and discriminative approaches. For this, we introduce the notion of a âpull-backâ operation that enables us to predict the parameters of the test image using training samples that are not in its neighborhood (not Ïµ-close) in parameter space. We prove that our algorithm converges to the global optimum using a significantly lower number of training samples that grows only logarithmically with the desired accuracy.

The average speed of OpenCL FDTD simulations on a GPU was about 1.1 times lower than a comparable CUDA based solver for domains with sizes varying from 50<sup>3</sup>to 400<sup>3</sup>cells. Although OpenCL code dedicated to GPUs can be executed on multi-core CPUs, a direct porting does not provide satisfactory performance due to an application of architecture specific features in GPU code. Therefore, the OpenCL kernels of the developed FDTD code were optimized for multi-core CPUs. However, this improved OpenCL FDTD code was still about 1.5 to 2.5 times slower than the FDTD solver developed in the OpenMP parallel programming standard. The study concludes that, despite current performance drawbacks, the future potential of OpenCL is significant due to its flexibility and portability to various architectures.","","978-1-4244-7368-7978-1-4244-7366-3978-1-4244-7367","10.1109/ICEAA.2010.5653857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653857","","Finite difference methods;Graphics processing unit;Time domain analysis;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;Runtime;Central Processing Unit","finite difference time-domain analysis;parallel programming;programming languages","finite difference time-domain method;open computing language;usability;parallel processor programming;portability;computing architecture;multicore CPU;GPU code;FDTD code;OpenMP parallel programming standard","","5","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Of renewed interest is the use of symbolic reasoning for synthesising loop invariants, ranking functions, or whole program fragments and hardware circuits. Solvers for the quantifier-free fragment of bit-vector logic exist and often rely on SAT solvers for efficiency. However, many techniques require quantifiers in bit-vector formulas to avoid an exponential blow-up during construction. Solvers for quantified formulas usually flatten the input to obtain a quantified Boolean formula, losing much of the word-level information in the formula. We present a new approach based on a set of effective word-level simplifications that are traditionally employed in automated theorem proving, heuristic quantifier instantiation methods used in SMT solvers, and model finding techniques based on skeletons/templates. Experimental results on two different types of benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms the traditional flattening approach by multiple orders of magnitude of runtime.","","978-0-9835678-0-6978-1-4577-0734","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770955","","Density estimation robust algorithm;Hardware;Mathematical model;Cognition;Encoding;Benchmark testing;Software","Boolean functions;computability;formal verification;theorem proving","quantified bit-vector formulas;bit-precise reasoning;hardware and software verification;symbolic reasoning;synthesising loop invariants;ranking functions;program fragments;hardware circuits;quantifier-free fragment;bit-vector logic;SAT solvers;exponential blow-up;quantified formulas;quantified Boolean formula;word-level information;word-level simplifications;automated theorem proving;heuristic quantifier instantiation methods;SMT solvers;model finding techniques;skeletons;flattening approach","","1","29","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We exploit the observation that many GPU applications exhibit error tolerance to propose branch and data herding. Branch herding eliminates control divergence by forcing all threads in a warp to take the same control path. Data herding eliminates memory divergence by forcing each thread in a warp to load from the same memory block. To safely and efficiently support branch and data herding, we propose a static analysis and compiler framework to prevent exceptions when control and data errors are introduced, a profiling framework that aims to maximize performance while maintaining acceptable output quality, and hardware optimizations to improve the performance benefits of exploiting error tolerance through branch and data herding. Our software implementation of branch herding on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 improves performance by up to 34% (13%, on average) for a suite of NVIDIA CUDA SDK and Parboil [7] benchmarks. Our hardware implementation of branch herding improves performance by up to 55% (30%, on average). Data herding improves performance by up to 32% (25%, on average). Observed output quality degradation is minimal for several applications that exhibit error tolerance, especially for visual computing applications.

We present an instruction set extension identification pass implemented in the COINS compiler which can simultaneously enumerate candidate instruction set extensions in multiple basic blocks.

As a result, future chips can no longer rely on simply increasing the operational core count to improve performance without surpassing a reasonable power budget. Alternatively, allocating die area towards accelerators targeting an application, or an application domain, appears quite promising, and this paper makes an argument for a neural network hardware accelerator. After being hyped in the 1990s, then fading away for almost two decades, there is a surge of interest in hardware neural networks because of their energy and fault-tolerance properties. At the same time, the emergence of high-performance applications like Recognition, Mining, and Synthesis (RMS) suggest that the potential application scope of a hardware neural network accelerator would be broad. In this paper, we want to highlight that a hardware neural network accelerator is indeed compatible with many of the emerging high-performance workloads, currently accepted as benchmarks for high-performance micro-architectures. For that purpose, we develop and evaluate software neural network implementations of 5 (out of 12) RMS applications from the PARSEC Benchmark Suite. Our results show that neural network implementations can achieve competitive results, with respect to application-specific quality metrics, on these 5 RMS applications.","","978-1-4673-4532-3978-1-4673-4531","10.1109/IISWC.2012.6402898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402898","neural networks;benchmark;accelerator;PARSEC","Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Benchmark testing;Hardware;Optimization;Wires","neural chips;neural net architecture;power aware computing;software fault tolerance","BenchNN;hardware neural network accelerators;device sizes;die area allocation;application domain;energy properties;fault-tolerance properties;recognition-mining-and-synthesis;RMS applications;high-performance workloads;high-performance microarchitectures;software neural network implementations;PARSEC Benchmark Suite;voltage scaling;application-specific quality metrics","","44","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Where possible, sensitive customers are supplied by two low-voltage utility feeders one of which is used as backup. Bus Transfer is able to provide the sensitive loads with a fast transfer to the backup feeder when the main one fails. This paper presents a new method to optimize harmonic estimation in bus transfer systems that use thyristor-based static transfer switch. The method uses filter bank property of Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform to measure the effective values of harmonics which are compatible with IEC standards, and implements them in power quality indices for operation of bus transfer systems. Implementation of wavelet packet transform has the benefit of inter-harmonic recognition, low spectral leakage, and the use of inappropriate length of a sampling window. The proposed method decomposes the voltage and current waveforms into uniform frequency bands corresponding to harmonics, and uses an optimized method to reduce the spectral leakage due to imperfect frequency response of the applied wavelet filter bank. As a case study, by using PSCAD software linked with MATLAB, the method is implemented and tested on a harmonic polluted network. The simulation results show the high accuracy of the proposed method.","2325-9272;2325-9280","978-1-4673-0665-2978-1-4673-0663-8978-1-4673-0664","10.1109/ICREDG.2012.6190466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190466","Harmonics;Bus Transfer;Selective Gating Strategy;Power Quality;Wavelet;WPT","Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Training;Filter banks;Vectors;Transforms","channel bank filters;discrete wavelet transforms;distributed power generation;IEC standards;neural nets;power engineering computing;power harmonic filters;power system measurement;radial basis function networks;thyristor applications","optimized harmonic estimation;bus transfer systems;polluted grid;distributed generation unit;wavelet transform;radial basis functions neural networks;filter bank;discrete wavelet packet transform;harmonic effective value;IEC standard;harmonic polluted network;thyristor-based static transfer switch;power quality indices;PSCAD software;MATLAB","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these detectors, every such operation results in a vector-based assignment to a vector clock, even though the assigned value is the same as the value of the vector clock right before the assignment. The cost of such vector-based operations however grows with the number of threads and the amount of such operations. It is unclear to what extent redundant assignments can be removed. Whether two consecutive assignments to the same vector clock of a thread result in the same content critically depends on the operations on the locks occurred in between these assignments. In this paper, we systematically explore the said insight and quantify a sufficient condition that can soundly remove such operations without affecting the precision of such tracking. We applied our approach on Fast Track to formulate LOFT. We evaluate LOFT using the PARSEC benchmarking suite. The result shows that, on average, LOFT removes 58.0% of all such operations incurred by Fast Track, and runs 16.2% faster than the latter in tracking the causal relations among these operations.","2332-6549;1071-9458;1071-9458","978-1-4577-2060-4978-0-7695-4568","10.1109/ISSRE.2011.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132964","data race detection;redundant operation optimization","Vectors;Clocks;Instruction sets;Detectors;Heuristic algorithms;Synchronization;Algorithm design and analysis","benchmark testing;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;synchronisation","LOFT;redundant synchronization event removal;data race detection;multithreaded program;synchronization operation;vector-based assignment;vector clock;vector-based operation;PARSEC benchmarking suite;fast track;causal relations tracking","","8","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correct prioritization of bugs helps in bug fix scheduling/assignment and resource allocation. Failure of this will result in delay of resolving important bugs. This requires a bug prediction system which can predict the priority of a newly reported bug. Cross project validation is also an important concern in empirical software engineering where we train classifier on one project and test it for prediction on other projects.

As many process variables of a WWTP are not measurable online, the development of an efficient control strategy is one of the greatest challenges in the optimization of WWTP operation. This paper presents an approach, which combines the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and a clustering algorithm to identify operational patterns in WWTP process data. These patterns provide a basis for the optimization of controller set points that are well suited for the previously identified operation regimes of the plant. The optimization is performed using Genetic Algorithms. This approach was developed, tested and validated on a simulation model based on the Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1).

Most applications perform expensive stack walking to recover contexts. The resulting contexts are often explicitly represented as a sequence of call sites and hence bulky. We propose a technique to encode the current calling context of any point during an execution. In particular, an acyclic call path is encoded into one number through only integer additions. Recursive call paths are divided into acyclic subsequences and encoded independently. We leverage stack depth in a safe way to optimize encoding: if a calling context can be safely and uniquely identified by its stack depth, we do not perform encoding. We propose an algorithm to seamlessly fuse encoding and stack depth based identification. The algorithm is safe because different contexts are guaranteed to have different IDs. It also ensures contexts can be faithfully decoded. Our experiments show that our technique incurs negligible overhead (1.89% on average). For most medium-sized programs, it can encode all contexts with just one number. For large programs, we are able to encode most calling contexts to a few numbers.","1558-1225;0270-5257","978-1-60558-719","10.1145/1806799.1806875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062056","calling context;dynamic context sensitivity;profiling","Context;Encoding;Instruments;Decoding;Runtime;Testing;Legged locomotion","program debugging;program testing","precise calling context encoding;profiling;debugging;event logging;expensive stack walking;acyclic call path;integer addition;recursive call path;acyclic subsequence;stack depth based identification;medium-sized program","","3","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Techniques such as removing unused instructions, software emulation of instructions, custom instruction set extensions, and run-time reconfigurable instructions have been suggested. However, the techniques have largely been studied separately from each other. The contribution of this paper is a classification method enabling integration of these techniques. This allows for generating an application specific microprocessor based system from a given program. The generated microprocessor is optimized with respect to performance per area. The improvement of our methodology is demonstrated for the CoreBench benchmark. The benefit of combining the removal of unused instructions (ISA subsetting) with software emulation of rarely used instructions is shown to increase performance while at the same time reducing resource requirements. Improvement in both area and performance is accomplished thorough simplifying the design allowing an increase in clock frequency for the synthesized soft CPU. Optimizing only by using custom instructions allowed a 12% increase in performance, but also increased resource usage by 6%. Software emulation combined with ISA subsetting allowed area savings of 7%, but only improved performance by 3%. By combining custom instructions, software emulation and ISA subsetting, we achieved an performance improvement of 15% while at the same time reducing resource requirements.","","978-1-4673-1188-5978-1-4673-1187-8978-1-4673-1186","10.1109/DDECS.2012.6219024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219024","ISA (Instruction set architecture) subsetting;Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA);Instruction Set Extension (ISE);custom instruction;reconfigurable instruction;application specific microprocessor","Hardware;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Kernel;Microprocessors;Benchmark testing","benchmark testing;instruction sets;multiprocessing systems;reconfigurable architectures","design technique;resource utilization;reconfigurable soft CPU;reconfigurable hardware;application specific customization;soft microprocessor;unused instruction removal;software emulation;custom instruction set extension;run-time reconfigurable instruction;classification method;application specific microprocessor based system;CoreBench benchmark;ISA subsetting;clock frequency;soft CPU synthesis;performance improvement;resource requirement reduction;instruction set architecture","","3","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many problems related to their usage, especially the large number of false positives, could easily hinder the potential benefits of such tools. Aims: Assess the percentage and type of issues of a popular bugfinding tool (FindBugs) that are actual defects. Method: We analyzed 301 Java Projects developed at a university with FindBugs, collecting the issues signalled on the source code. Afterwards, we checked the precision of issues with information on changes, we ranked and validated them using both manual inspection and validation with tests failures. Results: We observed that a limited set of issues have high precision and conversely we identified those issues characterized by low precision. We compared findings first with our previous experiment and then to related work: results are consistent with both of them. Conclusions: Since our and other empirical studies demonstrated that few issues are related to real defects with high precision, developers could enable only them (or prioritize), reducing the information overload of FindBugs and having the possibility to discover defects earlier. Furthermore, the technique presented in the paper can be adopted to other tools on a code base with tests to find issues with high precision that can be checked on code in production to find defects earlier.","","978-1-84919-509","10.1049/ic.2011.0018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6083173","","","data flow analysis;Java;program debugging;program verification;software tools","FindBugs issues;bug finding tools;source code verification;coding phase;Java projects","","6","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

By incorporating knowledge about the temporal behavior of such multi-mode systems, it is possible to share hardware by means of partial reconfiguration, and thus, reduce costs and improve performance. In this paper, we specify the temporal behavior of the functionality by applying known models based on state machines. In addition, we introduce an architectural model that allows to express the characteristics of nowadays partially reconfigurable architectures, focusing on FPGAs. We develop a symbolic encoding of this novel system specification, which allows to perform a unified system synthesis for allocation, binding, placement of partially reconfigurable modules, and routing the on-chip communication. The proposed encoding enables the use of sophisticated optimization techniques, coupling a SAT solver with a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed methodology is highly applicable for building multi-mode systems on advanced reconfigurable technology. We demonstrate this by experiments on test-cases from the image processing domain applying state-of-the-art technology. The results show the superiority of the presented approach in terms of run-time and quality of the found solutions compared to existing system synthesis approaches.","","978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0712","10.1145/2039370.2039393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062281","","Hardware;Resource management;Routing;Computer architecture;Tiles;System-on-a-chip;Switching circuits","encoding;evolutionary computation;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;optimisation;reconfigurable architectures;symbol manipulation","symbolic design space exploration;multimode reconfigurable system;operational mode;temporal behavior;partially reconfigurable architecture;state machine based model;FPGA;symbolic encoding;unified system synthesis;on-chip communication;optimization technique;SAT solver;multobjective evolutionary algorithm;image processing domain","","7","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advent of driverless cars provides opportunities for optimizing traffic in ways not possible before. This paper introduces an open source multiagent microscopic traffic simulator called AORTA, which stands for Approximately Orchestrated Routing and Transportation Analyzer, designed for optimizing autonomous traffic at a city-wide scale. AORTA creates scale simulations of the real world by generating maps using publicly available road data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This allows simulations to be set up through AORTA for a desired region anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. AORTA allows for traffic optimization by creating intelligent behaviors for individual driver agents and intersection policies to be followed by these agents. These behaviors and policies define how agents interact with one another, control when they cross intersections, and route agents to their destination. This paper demonstrates a simple application using AORTA through an experiment testing intersection policies at a city-wide scale.","2153-0017;2153-0009;2153-0009","978-1-4673-3063-3978-1-4673-3064-0978-1-4673-3062","10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338701","","Roads;Vehicles;Mobile robots;Generators;Humans;Delay;Data models","digital simulation;multi-agent systems;optimisation;public domain software;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","large-scale traffic simulation;autonomous vehicles;driverless cars;open source multiagent microscopic traffic simulator;AORTA;approximately orchestrated routing and transportation analyzer;autonomous traffic optimization;intersection policies;OSM;OpenStreetMap;city-wide scale","","6","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The âdigitalâ microfluidic biochips (DM-FBs) are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic mi-crofluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools are being developed for DMFBs. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis and chip-level design to testing. Design automations are expected to alleviate the burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.","","978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0715-4978-1-4503-0712","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062306","Microfluidics;biochips;design automation","Electrodes;Routing;Design automation;Arrays;Pins;Wires;Mixers","biochemistry;bioMEMS;computer aided analysis;electrodes;lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics","digital microfluidic biochips;biochemical analyzers;integrate on-chip;biochemical analysis;continuous flow;discrete droplets;two-dimensional array;electrodes;mixing;dilution;microelectronics;computer-aided-design tools;design complexity;automated synthesis;fluidic-level synthesis;chip-level design;manual optimization;bioassays;time-consuming chip designs;nanoscale bioassays;chip optimization","","","50","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, early prediction helps estimate the âhardware costâ of a given high-level code segment before the actual synthesis, dramatically reducing the time required for an exhaustive exploration of different design choices. Clearly, this early estimation is inherently influenced by the specific toolchain for HLL-to-HDL translation. As a consequence, suitable early prediction metrics should be studied and carefully selected for each given toolchain. In this paper, we propose a general framework for the systematic study of such metrics. Unlike some previous works, the proposed framework is not specific to a given toolchain as it lets designers plug their own synthesis tool and characterize its behaviour in order to identify the most effective metrics to be used during the design space exploration. The framework is developed on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure along with the R statistical package used to perform regression analysis. For a specific HLL-to-HDL compiler chosen for tests, we collected extensive experimental results on a large base of benchmarks, which show interesting accuracy improvements over some related work previously presented and confirm the effectiveness of the framework in deriving a characterization of the underlying hardware compiler.","1946-1488;1946-147X;1946-1488","978-1-4244-7843-9978-1-4244-7842-2978-0-7695-4179","10.1109/FPL.2010.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694298","","Measurement;Hardware;Estimation;Software;Benchmark testing;Complexity theory;Optimization","hardware description languages;high level languages;program compilers;regression analysis","hardware complexity;HLL-to-HDL translation;HDL description;high level code segment;synthesis tool;space exploration;LLVM compiler infrastructure;R statistical package;regression analysis;hardware compiler;hardware-software partitioning;early estimation;early prediction metrics","","11","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach relies on a novel technique called reusable cycle checking, which reuses the previous order information when repeatedly checking cycle at different frontiers. In the context of pending period information, this technique significantly reduces the overall computational costs required by cycle checking, enabling linear-time (in the number of memory operations) memory consistency verification for any given multicore system with a constant number of processors. From a practical perspective, an industrial memory consistency verification tool, named XCHECK, has been developed based on our approach. XCHECK is capable of working with neither test program constraint nor dedicated hardware support in postsilicon verifications of many multiprocessor systems. Experimental results show that XCHECK is 3-10 times faster than a state-of-art software-based approach.

Most previous studies on the influence of cache sharing have concentrated on the design or management of shared cache. The observed influence is often constrained by the reliance on simulators, the use of out-of-date benchmarks, or the limited coverage of deciding factors. This paper describes a systematic measurement of the influence with most of the potentially important factors covered. The measurement shows some surprising results. Contrary to commonly perceived importance of cache sharing, neither positive nor negative effects from the cache sharing are significant for most of the program executions in the PARSEC benchmark suite, regardless of the types of parallelism, input data sets, architectures, numbers of threads, and assignments of threads to cores. After a detailed analysis, we find that the main reason is the mismatch between the software design (and compilation) of multithreaded applications and CMP architectures. By performing source code transformations on the programs in a cache-sharing-aware manner, we observe up to 53 percent performance increase when the threads are placed on cores appropriately, confirming the software-hardware mismatch as a main reason for the observed insignificance of the influence from cache sharing, and indicating the important role of cache-sharing-aware transformations-a topic only sporadically studied so far-for exerting the power of shared cache.","1045-9219;1558-2183;2161-9883","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095485","Shared cache;thread scheduling;parallel program optimizations;chip multiprocessors.","Instruction sets;Message systems;Benchmark testing;Libraries;Arrays;Systematics","cache storage;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading","CMP cache sharing;chip multiprocessor;multithreaded application;interthread cache contention;shared cache design;shared cache management;program execution;software-hardware mismatch;source code transformation;software design;parallelism","","6","34","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we enhance this framework to introduce automatic fault localization in constraint programs. Our approach is based on constraint relaxation to identify the constraint that is responsible of a given fault. CPTEST is henceforth able to automatically localize faults in optimized OPL programs.

Computational modelling of UHF PD sensors using Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation can simplify the process of sensor design and optimisation, reducing the development cost for repeated testing (in order to select the best materials and designs for the sensors), and giving greater insight into how the mechanical design and mounting will influence frequency response. This paper reports on an investigation into the application of FDTD methods in modelling and calibrating UHF PD sensors. This paper focuses on the disc-type sensor where the sensor has been modelled in software and the predicted responses are compared with experimental measurements. Results indicate that the FDTD method can accurately predict the output voltages and frequency responses of disc-type sensors.

The authors' original work that introduced these policies also provided a design methodology for them, but this methodology is limited by the fact that it necessitates the deployment of the entire state space of the considered RAS. Hence, this paper seeks the development of an alternative computational tool that can support the synthesis of correct generalized algebraic DAPs, while controlling the underlying computational complexity. More specifically, the presented correctness verification test possesses the convenient form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation that employs a number of variables and constraints polynomially related to the size of the underlying RAS, and it can be readily solved through canned optimization software. Furthermore, since generalized algebraic DAPs do not admit a convenient representation in the Petri net modeling framework, an additional contribution of the presented results is that they effect the migration of the relevant past insights and developments with respect to simpler DAP classes, from the representational framework of Petri nets to that of the Deterministic Finite-State Automata.","1545-5955;1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2009.2022985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196689","Deadlock avoidance;discrete-event systems;mathematical programming;resource allocation systems (RASs);supervisory control","System recovery;Mathematical programming;Digital audio players;Resource management;Design methodology;State-space methods;Computational complexity;Software testing;Linear programming;Polynomials","computational complexity;finite state machines;integer programming;operating systems (computers);Petri nets;resource allocation","correctness verification;generalized algebraic deadlock avoidance policies;mathematical programming;resource allocation systems;computational tool;computational complexity;mixed integer programming formulation;optimization software;Petri net modeling framework;deterministic finite state automata","","5","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We explore the possibility to optimize execution time of fingerprint minutiae-based feature extraction using parallel process. Hypothetically, in general using parallel process will be faster than using sequential process. Taking advantage of multicore processor technology, optimization of execution time of fingerprint feature extraction is conducted using parallel process by processor cores. We have identified the possibility to implement parallel process on 29 different routines that are executed once or more. We compare result of average execution time of a fingerprint feature extraction using parallel and sequential process on Set B of Database 1 of Fingerprint Verification Contest 2000, 2002, and 2004.

As such it has become increasingly practical to use outsourced database solutions. However, as the service provider may not be fully trusted, XML database outsourcing introduces several security concerns that are new or more complex than those encountered in traditional database implementations. These include: data confidentiality, privacy, secure auditing, query assurance and secure and efficient storage. Of particular importance due to its relevance to most outsourced database models is query assurance - ensuring the database responds correctly to queries. In this paper, we propose the use of temporary time stamps and hash granularity to increase the efficiency of query assurance. This approach is tested against real datasets of varying type and size. Further, we consider how best to create time stamps and the issues associated with expiring versus distributed time stamp models.","2332-5658;1550-445X;1550-445X","978-1-4244-6696-2978-1-4244-6695-5978-0-7695-4018","10.1109/AINA.2010.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474846","Outsourced Database;XML Database;Query Assurance","XML;Databases;Outsourcing;Information retrieval;Hardware;Bandwidth;Data security;Data privacy;Secure storage;Testing","data privacy;database management systems;outsourcing;query processing;storage management;XML","outsourced XML database;query assurance optimization;XML database outsourcing;external service provider;storage management;information retrieval;outsourced database solutions;data confidentiality;data privacy;secure auditing;temporary time stamps;hash granularity;distributed time stamp models","","2","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It involves understanding the impact of a plethora of parameters ranging from cluster configuration, partitioning, networking characteristics, and the targeted applications' behavior. The design space, and the scale of the clusters, make it cumbersome and error-prone to test different cluster configurations using real setups. Thus, the community is increasingly relying on simulations and models of cloud setups to infer system behavior and the impact of design choices. The accuracy of the results from such approaches depends on the accuracy and realistic nature of the workload traces employed. Unfortunately, few cloud workload traces are available (in the public domain). In this paper, we present the key steps towards analyzing the traces that have been made public, e.g., from Google, and inferring lessons that can be used to design realistic cloud workloads as well as enable thorough quantitative studies of Hadoop design.

We reinforce these quantitative results with survey feedback from 358 Microsoft employees who were involved in Windows bugs. Survey respondents also mentioned additional qualitative influences on bug fixing, such as the importance of seniority and interpersonal skills of the bug reporter. Informed by these findings, we built a statistical model to predict the probability that a new bug will be fixed (the first known one, to the best of our knowledge). We trained it on Windows Vista bugs and got a precision of 68% and recall of 64% when predicting Windows 7 bug fixes.

Johnson","NA; NA","2012 IEEE 12th International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation","","2012","","","54","63","This paper explores how much the source code analysis can assist worm defense system. Previously-proposed worm defense systems have used disparate mechanisms to detect worms, analyze exploits, verify alerts, and apply mitigations. Furthermore, previous systems have not offered predictability, i.e. it is not possible to verify, in advance, that the defense system will never generate a mitigation that breaks the program. This paper describes a program transformation technique that makes collaborative worm defense systems easy to build, predictable and fast-responsive. Our transformation provides a single building block that can be used to perform worm detection, exploit analysis, alert verification, and mitigation application. In fact, our transformation makes most of these tasks trivial. Furthermore, software vendors and users can test, in advance, that the defense system will very unlikely apply a mitigation that breaks their software. Mitigations are vulnerability-specific not exploit-specific. Finally, our system can respond extremely quickly to a new worm. The exploit analysis becomes trivial so sentinel hosts can issue an alert the instant they detect a worm. We have implemented a prototype of our system based on the Jones and Kelly program transformation for memory safety. During normal operation, our system incurs only 5% overhead. We take advantage of static analysis to develop several optimizations and make the Jones and Kelly approach to memory safety efficient and practical.","","978-0-7695-4783-1978-1-4673-2398","10.1109/SCAM.2012.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392102","","Grippers;Instruments;Solids;Optimization;Safety;Registers;Collaboration","computer viruses;formal verification;optimisation;program compilers;program diagnostics;source coding","source code analysis;compiler assisted worm defense;worm detection;program transformation technique;collaborative worm defense systems;exploit analysis;alert verification;vulnerability specific mitigation;memory safety;static analysis;optimization;Jones and Kelly approach","","2","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Theologically tailored conductive silver nano-ink was created to meet the rheological requirement of industrial printheads (XAAR 1001). The jetting optimization for the printhead was done using a desktop R&D inkjet printer from PiXDRO (OTB Solar). Printer-integrated software allowed the optimization of droplet formation and droplet stability during the jetting process. Typical printing parameters such as greyscale, DPI variation, substrate heating, etc., were optimized to achieve high print quality. However, initial printing results showed poor line definition and inhomogeneous film thickness. To overcome this, we developed a multiple pass printing process that results in excellent line definition. We also performed statistical analysis to correlate the droplet size with printed feature size. The minimum feature size of -15 Î¼m was achieved by jetting ~6 pi droplets. After printing, the films were sintered thermally to achieve metallization. Detailed TGA study showed that complete metallization was achieved at temperature 400Â°C. Adhesion tests performed using an ASTM standard tape test on printed pattern showed less than 5% of delamination or flaking. Finally, test prototypes of solar front electrodes were printed successfully on ITO and silicon substrates.","","978-1-4673-2871-5978-1-4673-2871-5978-1-4673-2870","10.1109/NMDC.2012.6527602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6527602","","","electrodes;ink jet printing;silver;sintering","printing optimization;thermal sintering;silver;nanoink;solar electrodes;industrial printhead;inkjet printing capability;metallization;temperature 400 degC","","2","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approval process can take considerable time, and the submitter cannot know whether the SAR will be successful until after the process completes. The problem compounded by the fact that reassignment of satellite beam carrier (SBC) frequencies to better suit new SARs is requires massive computation via the MUOS Performance Model (MPM) algorithms that can take over a day to run. To address these problems, this work demonstrates a dual-component software tool or planner. The first component is the SAR evaluator that evaluates a SAR's likelihood of success according to the same criteria that are considered when submitting a SAR over the SIPRNET for approval. It also shows a graphical assessment over time of the SAR's projected impact to the availability of various MUOS resources. The second component is the optimizer that rapidly determines SBC frequency assignments that minimize multi-access interference (MAI) on one or more MOUS satellites, given the newly specified SARs and currently committed traffic. The optimizer can aid the SAR submission process and can calculate âwhat-if scenariosâ for SAR evaluators who must determine regional or global bandwidth allocations. The investigation includes benchmarks on proof-of-concept algorithms to demonstrate the capability of the optimizer to determine the carrier-frequency assignments in a few seconds when operating on portable devices such as an ordinary laptop as well as a PDA having limited computational bandwidth.","2155-7586;2155-7578;2155-7578","978-1-4244-8180-4978-1-4244-8178-1978-1-4244-8179","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680392","SATCOM;MUOS;Multi-Access;MAI Minimization;frequency assignment optimization;Uplink;Downlink","Optimization;Satellites;Personal digital assistants;Benchmark testing;Downlink;Computational modeling;Bandwidth","frequency allocation;multi-access systems;satellite communication","mobile user objective system;frequency assignment configurations;satellite communication system;satellite access requests;satellite beam carrier;multi-access interference","","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thereby, the efficiency of Hadoop is significantly improved for data-intensive Map-Reduce applications, which naturally exhibit a high degree of data access concurrency.

The use of a convex model in terms of the continuous variables is particularly important because it ensures that an optimal solution obtained by a branch-and-cut algorithm for mixed-integer conic programming is global. In addition, good quality solutions with a relaxed optimality gap can be very efficiently obtained.

Large channel and firing counts have to be reduced to enable 3-D real-time imaging and simplify front-end electronics. Recently, we have proposed an optimization procedure for dual ring FL arrays which is based on finding an optimal coarray set using the simulated annealing algorithm. The presented algorithm is based on finding a predefined number of optimal firing set which results in elimination of redundant spatial frequencies in the coarray. In this study, we present the experimental demonstration of the proposed method with fabricated single chip CMUT on CMOS system based FL dual ring arrays. The dual ring CMUT arrays were monolithically fabricated on top of CMOS chips which have 25-V pulsers and low-noise transimpedance amplifiers for each transmit and receive array elements. The fabricated CMUT arrays have 56 transmit and 48 receive elements operating at 12 MHz with a 1.4 mm outer diameter. To test the imaging performance of the optimal reduced set, we obtained a 512-element coarray set from the full 2688-element set. In the experiment, we used a phantom of 100-Î¼m aluminium wires immersed in oil tank. We have reconstructed both 2-D PSFs and B-scan images of wire targets.

With normal production expectations of fast bonding and good quality performance on flimsy leadframe, copper wire challenges of small outline packages were incredible. Furthermore, situation became worse when new copper wire process was found requiring additional bonding time and mechanism due to harder material properties. In order to enjoy full saving of material cost, there was no loss expected on yield, quality, throughput, and machine efficiency. Under these stringent requirements, development of copper wire bonding process requires full considerations and optimization of all possible root causes, with targeted performance matching gold wire bonding process. By utilizing Six Sigma DMAIC methodology, appropriate characterization and optimization were performed on major elements, material, machine and bonding method. For wafer technology that come with thin top metal, bonding optimization was important in ensuring additional stress from Cu wire process would not cause any metal peeling. In order to achieve that, new bonding method was introduced by flattening bonded ball and then applying gentle ultrasonic vibration. This approach was later discovered to be one of the most important factors in ensuring successful reliability tests. When established process ran on more wire bonders, copper wire bonding was found very susceptible to leadframe clamping condition. Any slight unit floating caused positional type non-sticking, and most of time it happened regardless to any parameter settings. In order to resolve this issue on machines with multiple bonding sites, a new machine characterization methodology was established. This method focused and emphasized on variations of machine parts which are in contact with the leadframe. The most important tool created was the new quantifiable measuring sub-systems on machine parts, absolutely different from conventional type of product buyoff. On the machine itself, bonding mechanism was analyzed through new established external instruments, especially for some older generation machines that never provide such utilities in the operating software. Other than that, comprehensive study was also performed on the material factors. From the study of capillary, certain design and surface roughness provided significant advantage in the wire bond responses. As for the wire properties, study showed that wire coupling with optimum electrical firing parameters and air cushion could provide robust Free Air Ball formation, free from oxidation risk. In the overall combination of optimum settings and conditions, copper wire bonding showed significantly improved performance, whereby cycle time and reliability was not different from previous gold wire process. The project success was more precious when older machines were beneficial from the study, and therefore copper wire conversion did not require any capital investment. This project has enabled substantial amount of cost reduction possible for small outline packages, with zero impact to capacity or customer quality risk.","","978-1-4244-8562-8978-1-4244-8560-4978-1-4244-8561","10.1109/EPTC.2010.5702709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702709","","Wire;Copper;Bonding;Optimization;Fluid flow","copper;lead bonding;six sigma (quality);wafer level packaging","copper wire bonding;small outline packages;flimsy leadframe;Six Sigma DMAIC methodology;wafer technology;bonding optimization;ultrasonic vibration;leadframe clamping condition;wire coupling;electrical firing parameters;air cushion;free air ball formation;cost reduction;quality risk","","2","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Sentomist: Unveiling Transient Sensor Network Bugs via Symptom Mining","Y. Zhou; X. Chen; M. R. Lyu; J. Liu","NA; NA; NA; NA","2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","","2010","","","784","794","Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications are typically event-driven. While the source codes of these applications may look simple, they are executed with a complicated concurrency model, which frequently introduces software bugs, in particular, transient bugs. Such buggy logics may only be triggered by some occasionally interleaved events that bear implicit dependency, but can lead to fatal system failures. Unfortunately, these deeply-hidden bugs or even their symptoms can hardly be identified by state-of-the-art debugging tools, and manual identification from massive running traces can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present Sentomist (Sensor application anatomist), a novel tool for identifying potential transient bugs in WSN applications. The Sentomist design is based on a key observation that transient bugs make the behaviors of a WSN system deviate from the normal, and thus outliers (i.e., abnormal behaviors) are good indicators of potential bugs. Sentomist introduces the notion of event-handling interval to systematically anatomize the long-term execution history of an event-driven WSN system into groups of intervals. It then applies a customized outlier detection algorithm to quickly identify and rank abnormal intervals. This dramatically reduces the human efforts of inspection (otherwise, we have to manually check tremendous data samples, typically with brute force inspection) and thus greatly speeds up debugging. We have implemented Sentomist based on the concurrency model of TinyOS. We apply Sentomist to test a series of representative real-life WSN applications that contain transient bugs. These bugs, though caused by complicated interactions that can hardly be predicted during the programming stage, are successfully confined by Sentomist.","1063-6927;1063-6927","978-1-4244-7262-8978-1-4244-7261-1978-0-7695-4059","10.1109/ICDCS.2010.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541625","Sensor Networks;Debugging;Testing;Embedded Systems","Computer bugs;Wireless sensor networks;Application software;Concurrent computing;Debugging;Inspection;Logic;History;Detection algorithms;Humans","concurrency control;data mining;operating systems (computers);security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor network;transient bugs;symptom mining;complicated concurrency model;software bugs;buggy logics;Sentomist tool;sensor application anatomist tool;TinyOS model","","16","36","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"LnQ: Building High Performance Dynamic Binary Translators with Existing Compiler Backends","C. Hsu; P. Liu; C. Wang; J. Wu; D. Hong; P. Yew; W. Hsu","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing","","2011","","","226","234","This paper presents an LLVM+QEMU (LnQ)framework for building high performance and retargetable binary translators with existing compiler modules. Dynamic binary translation is a just-in-time (JIT) compilation from binary code of guest ISA to binary code of host ISA. The quality of translated code is critical to the performance of a dynamic binary translator, which translates code between different IS As, so the translated code is often carefully hand-optimized. As a result, it takes tremendous implementation efforts for software engineers to port an existing dynamic binary translator to anew host ISA. The goal of LnQ framework is to enable the process of building high performance and retarget able dynamic binary translators with existing optimizers and code generation back ends. LnQ framework consists of a translation module and an emulation engine. We design the translation module based on LLVM compiler infrastructure, and use QEMU as our emulation engine. We implement an x86-to-x86 64 dynamic binary translator with our LnQ framework to show that the framework is retarget able, and conduct experiments on SPECCPU2006 benchmarks to show that the resulting binary translator has good performance. The experiment results indicate that the x86-to-x86 64 LnQ translator achieves an average speedup of 1.62X in integer benchmarks, and 3.02X in floating point benchmarks than QEMU.","0190-3918;0190-3918;2332-5690","978-1-4577-1336-1978-0-7695-4510","10.1109/ICPP.2011.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6047191","Dynamic Binary Translation;Optimization;LLVM;QEMU","Registers;Emulation;Engines;Optimization;Joining processes;Benchmark testing;Libraries","program compilers;program interpreters;virtual machines","dynamic binary translator;compiler backend;just-in-time compilation;guest ISA;host ISA;binary code;LnQ framework;code generation backend;QEMU emulation engine;LLVM compiler infrastructure;low level virtual machine","","2","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this problem, Continuation Power Flow (CPF) method was come up. CPF method is a very powerful method that can give the solution without having the singularity problem. The CPF method has then been improved using new CPF-GMRES method. In contrary, NRS (Newton - Raphson - Seydel) is old method but is fast and accurate. This paper expands existing NRS method which then demonstrated that it is more reliable and faster than CPF-GMRES and NRS.

FTRs are issued based on a process of solving a constrained optimization problem with the objective to maximize the FTR social welfare under power flow security constraints. Security constraints for different FTR categories (monthly, seasonal or annual) are usually coupled and the number of constraints increases exponentially with the number of categories. Commercial software for FTR calculation can only provide limited categories of FTRs due to the inherent computational challenges mentioned above. In this paper, first an innovative mathematical reformulation of the FTR problem is presented, which dramatically improves the computational efficiency of optimization problem. After having re-formulated the problem, a novel non-linear dynamic system (NDS) approach is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The new formulation and performance of the NDS solver is benchmarked against widely used linear programming (LP) solvers like CPLEXâ¢. Tests are performed on both standard IEEE test systems and large-scale systems using data from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).

We implemented an extension to the OLSR protocol to support the delivery of multicast traffic using the Overlay Borovka-based Ad-hoc Multicast Protocol (OBAMP). We present a demo of our implementation that is devised for the GNU/Linux operating system. The implementation has been tested both on standard PCs and on embedded devices running OpenWRT and it is distributed as a plugin within the olsr.org OLSR implementation.

It is particularly important for debugging embedded systems. Instrumented programs produce data traces which enable the developer to locate the origins of misbehaviors in the system under test. However, producing data traces incurs runtime overhead in the form of additional computation resources for capturing and copying the data. The instrumentation may therefore interfere with the system's timing and perturb its behavior. In this work, we propose an instrumentation technique for applications with temporal constraints, specifically targeting background/foreground or cyclic executive systems. Our framework permits reasoning about space and time and enables the composition of software instrumentations. In particular, we propose a definition for trace reliability, which enables us to instrument real-time applications which aggressively push their time budgets. Using the framework, we present a method with low perturbation by optimizing the number of insertion points and trace buffer size with respect to code size and time budgets. Finally, we apply the theory to two concrete case studies: we instrument the OpenEC firmware for the keyboard controller of the One Laptop Per Child project, as well as an implementation of a flash file system.","1551-3203;1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2010.2068304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559440","Debugging;instrumentation;real-time systems;tracing","Reliability;Real time systems;Monitoring;Computational modeling;Debugging;Embedded systems;Runtime","embedded systems;firmware;program debugging","time-aware instrumentation;embedded software;embedded systems debugging;trace reliability;OpenEC firmware;keyboard controller;one laptop per child project;flash file system","","20","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It represents humanity's long-time dream of elevating computers beyond the realm of simple machines for the calculation and processing of data. With the incorporation of artificial intelligence, computers are able to engage in behavior similar to human thought, helping humans perform necessary tasks of cognition, theorizing, and even judgment. Genetic algorithms (GA) are a branch of artificial intelligence and have been demonstrated to be fast and accurate in the pursuit of efficiency and accuracy. GA is often applied to optimization problems for single and multiple targets. Progress in computer hardware and software programming language has driven the development of artificial intelligence. All applications or research relevant to artificial intelligence algorithms require computer programs that meet individual constraints and individual objectives; in other words, each different problem has its own specialized computer program. Though software suites based on GA already exist (e.g., Evolver, SUGAL), these have limitations in practical usage and may be unable to fully realize the effectiveness of GA. As such, this study utilizes Microsoft Visual Basic to develop an open source standard module system based on GA, allowing users to create programs which meet problem constraints within a short period of time. When standard program modules are unable to meet these requirements, users can also customize the original source code according to particular demands. Research results demonstrate that standard module systems built on GA can help users to complete computer programs within a short period of time, and also increase the accuracy of programs. This study has already developed around 30 standard program modules. Testing has already been completed for all program modules, and the open source code for all program modules has been placed on the http://cost.ce.cyut.edu.tw/lab website for download.","","978-1-4577-0816-9978-1-4577-0813-8978-1-4577-0815","10.1109/ICICIP.2011.6008251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6008251","","Genetic algorithms;Biological cells;Artificial intelligence;Computers;Genetics;Encoding;Accuracy","artificial intelligence;cognition;genetic algorithms;public domain software;Visual BASIC","genetic algorithm;artificial intelligence module system;optimization problems;computer hardware;software programming language;Microsoft Visual Basic;open source standard module system","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An obvious choice is to use a FPGA (apart from dedicated front-end electronics) as a first stage of data storage and processing element. Furthermore the FPGA has to prepare and transfer the incoming/processed data to the host PC. The implementation of the data exchange can be a problem, especially for small groups of developers, who have an option to buy a general solution with its limitations and a price, or to do time-consuming development of their own system practically from scratch. This paper presents a FPGA based general purpose readout solution which lies in between the two opposite approaches. Presented system uses a FPGA mezzanine board equipped with Ethernet Gigabit connection to PC. The FPGA FIFO based readout of a digital data stream is packed directly into the Ethernet frames and send to the destination PC using point-to point connection. The standard Ethernet frames are used in this design, additionally equipped with one byte carrying information on data type. When a high throughput is needed the data type is employed to prioritize them. This moderately simple but very powerful interface is relatively easy to be implemented in many applications [1]. The custom approach chosen for FPGA implementation causes a need to prepare dedicated software suite to process all incoming data in the PC side. The developed software package is called EPPRO (Ethernet Packet PROxy) since it exploits special Ether net frames for data exchange. The core part of EPPRO is a Linux kernel module, responsible for data reception/transmission and dispatching, taking into account their types to filter and prioritize the incoming packets. Overall performance of the whole system has been evaluated in respect to its throughput and reliability, presented test results confirm that all of the design goals have been fulfilled.","1082-3654;1082-3654","978-1-4673-0120-6978-1-4673-0118-3978-1-4673-0119","10.1109/NSSMIC.2011.6154542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6154542","FPGA;Ethernet;network protocol;kernel driver;readout system","Field programmable gate arrays;Sockets;Indexes;Payloads;Clocks;Decoding;Random access memory","data acquisition;data communication;digital storage;electronic data interchange;field programmable gate arrays;flexible electronics;high energy physics instrumentation computing;Linux;local area networks;microcomputers;nuclear electronics;readout electronics;software packages","readout data acquisition system;detection system;FPGA;front-end electronics;data processing element;incoming data;data processing;data exchange;FPGA mezzanine board;ethernet gigabit connection;FPGA FIFO;digital data stream;PC;standard Ethernet frame;EPPRO software package;Linux kernel module;data reception;data transmission;data dispatching;incoming data packet","","5","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, a multiobjective optimisation technique based on a simple random search algorithm is deployed to dynamically infer and refine the specification of three agent-based models from their simulations. The multiobjective optimisation technique also incorporates a dynamic invariant detection technique which serves to guide the search towards uncovering new model behaviour that better captures the model specification.

In addition, cDE employs the mutation and crossover typical of differential evolution (DE) thus reproducing its search logic. Unlike other compact evolutionary algorithms, in cDE, the survivor selection scheme of DE can be straightforwardly encoded. One important feature of the proposed cDE algorithm is the capability of efficiently performing an optimization process despite a limited memory requirement. This fact makes the cDE algorithm suitable for hardware contexts characterized by small computational power such as micro-controllers and commercial robots. In addition, due to its nature cDE uses an implicit randomization of the offspring generation which corrects and improves the DE search logic. An extensive numerical setup has been implemented in order to prove the viability of cDE and test its performance with respect to other modern compact evolutionary algorithms and state-of-the-art population-based DE algorithms. Test results show that cDE outperforms on a regular basis its corresponding population-based DE variant. Experiments have been repeated for four different mutation schemes. In addition cDE outperforms other modern compact algorithms and displays a competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art population-based algorithms employing a DE logic. Finally, the cDE is applied to a challenging experimental case study regarding the on-line training of a nonlinear neural-network-based controller for a precise positioning system subject to changes of payload. The main peculiarity of this control application is that the control software is not implemented into a computer connected to the control system but directly on the micro-controller. Both numerical results on the test functions and experimental results on the real-world problem are very promising and allow us to think that cDE and future developments can be an efficient option for optimization in hardware environments characterized by limited memory.","1089-778X;1089-778X;1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2058120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675671","Adaptive systems;compact genetic algorithms;differential evolution (DE);estimation distribution algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Training;Robots;Memory management;Hardware","evolutionary computation;formal logic;learning (artificial intelligence);microcontrollers;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;position control;search problems","compact differential evolution;cDE algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;statistic description;search logic;optimization process;population based algorithm;neural network based training;nonlinear neural network based controller;positioning system;precise positioning system;control software;microcontroller system;limited memory","","129","63","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this problem, a postmanufacture self-tuning technique that aims to compensate for multiparameter variations is presented. The proposed method incorporates a Â¿response featureÂ¿ detector and Â¿hardware tuning knobs,Â¿ designed into the RF circuit. The RF device test response to a specially crafted diagnostic test stimulus is logged via the built-in detector and embedded analog-to-digital converter. Analysis and prediction of the optimal tuning knob control values for performance compensation is performed using software running on the baseband DSP processor. As a result, the RF circuit performance can be diagnosed and tuned with minimal assistance from external test equipment. Multiple RF performance parameters can be adjusted simultaneously under tuning knob control. The proposed concepts are illustrated for an RF low-noise amplifier (LNA) design and can be applied to other RF circuits as well.

The opportunistic radio (OR) is considered in this work, with a narrower definition where the awareness is limited to the spectrum knowledge. The decision making framework is employed as a crucial entity to control the behaviour of the OR. The main purpose is to enable an efficient spectrum usage while avoiding the interference to other users. This study describes the proposed OR decision making framework including the flow of context information as an input process to the decision making engine, the context filtering and the reasoning mechanisms in which the decision optimisation is achieved using a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach. The system stability of the GA-based reasoning engine is tested through simulations. Then, the experimental study is performed on a test platform for a practical proof of the concept. The test platform is based on the Ettus USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) hardware and the GNU Radio open source software. Several tests were carried out to observe the OR capabilities of the proposed decision making framework.

Moore's Law continues to deliver ever-more transistors on an integrated circuit, but discontinuities in the progress of technology mean that the future isn't simply an extrapolation of the past. For example, design cost and complexity constraints have recently caused the microprocessor industry to switch to multi-core architectures, even though these parallel machines present programming challenges that are far from solved. Moore's Law now translates into ever-more processors on a multi-, and soon many-core chip. The software challenge is compounded by the need for increasing fault-tolerance as near-atomic-scale variability and robustness problems bite harder. We look beyond this transitional phase to a future where the availability of processor resource is effectively unlimited and computations must be optimised for energy usage rather than load balancing, and we look to biology for examples of how such systems might work. Conventional concerns such as synchronisation and determinism are abandoned in favour of real-time operation and adapting around component failure with minimal loss of system efficacy.","1558-1101;1530-1591;1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8978-3-9810801-8","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176422","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a mathematical distribution system planning model considering three planning options to system expansion and to meet the load growth requirements with a reasonable price as well as the system power quality problems. DG is introduced as an attractive planning option with competition of voltage regulator devices and interruptible load. In mathematical model, the object function includes investment costs, which are evaluated as annualized total cost, plus total running cost as well as cost of curtailed loads and losses. This model identifies the optimal type, size and location of the planning options. This paper is also studied fluctuation of load and electricity market price versus time period and the effect of DG placement on system improvement.

Analytical calculation of the quality of a configuration is necessary for effectively assigning new services to servers and reorganizing assigned services. This work describes the Provisioning Norm which meets this critical need. The Provisioning Norm (an asymmetric norm) analytically calculates the quality of a configuration, the placement of services on server nodes. The Provisioning Norm partially orders all possible configurations for a set of nodes and services from best to worst by numerically biasing over-provisioned configurations relative to under-provisioned configurations. This work proves that the parameter to the Provisioning Norm function has a value which partitions the partially ordered configurations into over-provisioned configurations and under-provisioned configurations. The application of the Provisioning Norm in a testing environment demonstrates a correlation between the analytical quality and the empirical performance.","","978-1-4577-0863-3978-0-7695-4462","10.1109/SCC.2011.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009251","web services;quality;asymmetric norm;placement","Servers;Peer to peer computing;Virtual machining;Bandwidth;Databases;Optimization;Resource management","cloud computing;resource allocation;software quality","asymmetric quality measure;SaaS resource allocation;software as a service;provisioning norm;server nodes;partially ordered configurations;over provisioned configurations;under provisioned configurations","","4","18","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, many multilocus maps were constructed using diverse mapping populations and marker sets for the same species. The quality of maps varied broadly between populations, marker sets, and applied software. There might be some inconsistencies between different versions of the maps for the same organism, calling for the integration of mapping information and building of consensus maps. The problem of multilocus consensus genetic mapping (MCGM) is even more challenging, compared to multilocus mapping based on one data set, due to several complications: differences in recombination rate and distribution along chromosomes, and different subsets of markers used by different labs. We developed an approach to solve MCGM problems, by searching multilocus orders with the maximum number of shared markers yielding maps with minimum total length. The approach is based on re-analysis of raw data and is implemented in a two-phase algorithm. In Phase 1, for each data set, multilocus ordering is performed combined with iterative re-sampling to evaluate the stability of marker orders. In this phase, the ordering problem is reduced to the well known Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In Phase 2, consensus mapping is conducted by reducing the problem to a specific version of TSP that can be referred to as synchronized TSP. The optimal consensus order of shared markers is defined by the minimal total length of non-conflicting maps of the chromosome. This criterion includes various modifications that take into account the variation in the quality of the original data (e.g., population size, marker quality, etc.). We use our powerful Guided Evolution Strategy algorithm for discrete optimization of constrained problems that was adapted to solve MCGM problems. The developed approach was tested on a wide range of simulated data.","2157-9555;2157-9563","978-1-4244-5961-2978-1-4244-5958-2978-1-4244-5959","10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5583617","genetic mapping;consensus mapping;shared markers;guided evolution strategy algorithm;discrete optimization;synchronized-TSP","Optimization;Biological cells;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetics;Synchronization;Buildings;Stability criteria","biology computing;data analysis;DNA;evolutionary computation;genetics;iterative methods;travelling salesman problems","synchronized-TSP;multilocus genetic consensus mapping;diverse mapping population;map quality;mapping information;shared markers;multilocus ordering;iterative resampling;ordering problem;traveling salesperson problem;chromosome nonconflicting maps;population size;marker quality;guided evolution strategy algorithm;discrete optimization;constrained problems","","","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this novel approach, only the timing-critical modules are loaded at power-up using the first high-priority bitstream, while the non-timing critical modules are loaded afterwards. This two-step or prioritized FPGA start-up is used in order to meet the extremely tight startup timing specifications found in many modern applications, like PCI-express or automotive applications. Finally, the developed tool flow and methods for Fast Start-up have been used and tested to implement a CAN-based automotive ECU on a Spartan-6 evaluation board (i.e., SP605).

"Performance Evaluation of Intel and Portland Compilers Using Intel Westmere Processor","M. Al-Mulhem; R.

This interest is driven by the fact that the microchip technology is gradually reaching its physical limitations in terms of heat dissipation and power consumption. Therefore and as an extension to Moore's law, recent trends in high performance and grid computing have shown that future increases in performance can only be reached through increases in systems scale using a larger number of components, supported by scalable parallel programming models. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of two commonly used parallel compilers, Intel and Portland's PGI, using a state-of-the-art Intel West mere-based HPC cluster. The performance evaluation is based on two sets of experiments, once evaluating the compilers' performance using an MPI-based code, and another using OpenMP. Our results show that, for scientific applications that are matrices-dependant, the MPI and OpenMP features of the Intel compiler supersede PGI when using the defined HPC cluster.","2166-0662;2166-0670","978-1-4244-9809","10.1109/ISMS.2011.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730357","HPC;Intel compiler;PGI compiler;Infiniband","Optimization;Switches;Instruction sets;Benchmark testing;Programming;Servers;Schedules","application program interfaces;grid computing;message passing;microprocessor chips;parallel programming;program compilers;software performance evaluation","performance evaluation;Intel compiler supersede PGI;Portland compilers;Intel Westmere processor;parallel computing;distributed computing;parallel programming models;microchip technology;heat dissipation;power consumption;Moore law;grid computing;parallel compilers;MPI-based code;OpenMP","","","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time multiple applications are intended to run concurrently on the devices with such heterogeneous architectures. This rapid growth in the complexity of the hardware and its use cases imposes new challenges on the software development tools. To overcome this complexity, model of computation based approaches are becoming increasingly promising. Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) is a popular specification formalism for streaming applications with inherently concurrent nature. However, the parallelism expressed in the original representation is often not sufficient to maximally exploit the potential of multicore platforms. In this paper we present a holistic methodology for improving the throughput of streaming applications while mapping them onto heterogeneous architectures. The approach uses transformations that adapt the parallelism in SDF according to available platform resources. We use a genetic algorithm to explore SDF instances with the objective of maximizing throughput on a target platform. Our model supports architecture heterogeneity and multi-application scenarios. The experiments indicate that our approach outperforms other techniques for exploiting parallelism on a single application in most of the test cases and enables concurrent applications optimization.","","978-1-4673-2297-3978-1-4673-2295-9978-1-4673-2296","10.1109/SAMOS.2012.6404168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404168","","Parallel processing;Program processors;Computer architecture;Delay;Throughput;Merging;Production","concurrency control;data flow computing;embedded systems;genetic algorithms;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;software engineering;system-on-chip","throughput driven transformations;synchronous data flow;heterogeneous MPSoC;energy efficiency requirements;embedded systems;multicore architectures;processing engines;nonuniform interconnect fabrics;heterogeneous architecture;software development tools;computation based approach;specification formalism;streaming applications;holistic methodology;platform resources;genetic algorithm;SDF instances;target platform;throughput maximization;architecture heterogeneity;multiapplication scenario;concurrent application optimization;multiprocessor system-on-chip architecture","","9","22","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is becoming one of the fastest growing segments in the cloud computing market. However, as far as we know, there is little work done to understand the behavior of desktop cloud. On one hand, desktop cloud workloads are different from conventional data center workloads in that they are rich with interactive operations. Desktop cloud workloads are different from traditional non-virtualized desktop workloads in that they have an extra layer of software stack - hypervisor. On the other hand, desktop cloud servers are mostly built with conventional commodity processors. While such processors are well optimized for traditional desktops and high performance computing workloads, their effectiveness for desktop cloud workloads remains to be studied. As an attempt to shed some lights on the effectiveness of conventional general-purpose processors on desktop cloud workloads, we have studied the behavior of desktop cloud workloads and compared it with that of SPEC CPU2006, TPC-C, PARSEC, and CloudSuite. We evaluate a Xen-based virtualization platform. The performance results reveal that desktop cloud workloads have significantly different characteristics with SPEC CPU2006, TPC-C and PARSEC, but they perform similarly with data center scale-out benchmarks from CloudSuite. In particular, desktop cloud workloads have high instruction cache miss rate (12.7% on average), high percentage of kernel instructions (23%, on average), and low IPC (0.36 on average). And they have much higher TLB miss rates and lower utilization of off-chip memory bandwidth than traditional benchmarks. Our experimental numbers indicate that the effectiveness of existing commodity processors is quite low for desktop cloud workloads. In this paper, we provide some preliminary discussions on some potential architectural and micro-architectural enhancements. We hope that the performance numbers presented in this paper will give some insights to the designers of desktop cloud systems.","","978-1-4673-4532-3978-1-4673-4531","10.1109/IISWC.2012.6402917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402917","","Benchmark testing;Servers;Program processors;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Virtual machine monitors","cache storage;cloud computing;software performance evaluation;virtual machines;virtualisation","desktop cloud workloads;microarchitectural characterization;virtualized systems;cloud computing market;interactive operations;software stack;hypervisor;desktop cloud servers;Xen-based virtualization platform;instruction cache miss rate;kernel instructions;IPC;TLB miss rates;off-chip memory bandwidth;commodity processors","","3","37","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, two problems are formulated. First, we show how a polyhedral method can be used to design, for array-based data-intensive embedded applications, an application-specific hybrid memory architecture that has both shared and private components. We evaluate the resulting memory configurations using a set of benchmarks and compare them to pure private and pure shared memory on-chip multiprocessor architectures. The second approach proposed consider dynamic configuration of software-managed on-chip memory space to adapt to the runtime variations in data storage demand and interprocessor sharing patterns.

However, to our knowledge, most of the previous live VM migration techniques concentrated on the migration of a single VM which means these techniques are insufficient when the whole virtual cluster or multiple virtual clusters need to be migrated. This paper investigates various live migration strategies for virtual clusters (VC). We first describe a framework VC-Migration to control the migration of virtual clusters. Then we perform a series of experiments to study the performance and overheads of different migration strategies for virtual clusters, including concurrent migration, mutual migration, homogeneous VC migration, and heterogeneous VC migration. After that, we present several optimization principles to improve the migration performance of virtual clusters. The HPCC benchmark is selected to represent the virtual cluster workloads, and the metrics such as downtime, total migration time, and workload performance are measured.

To demonstrate the utility of the proposed stochastic approach, we developed the tool for optimizing routing architecture (TORCH) software based on the versatile place and route tool. Given FPGA architecture parameters and a set of benchmark designs, TORCH simultaneously optimizes the routing channel segmentation and switch box patterns using the performance metric of average interconnect power-delay product estimated from placed and routed benchmark designs. Special techniques - such as incremental routing, infrequent placement, multi-modal move selection, and parallelized metric evaluation - are developed to reduce the overall run time and improve the quality of results. Our experimental results have shown that the stochastic design strategy is quite effective in co-optimizing both routing channel segmentation and switch patterns. With the optimized routing architecture, relative to the performance of our chosen architecture baseline, TORCH can achieve average improvements of 24% and 15% in delay and power consumption for the 20 largest Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmark designs, and 27% and 21% for the eight benchmark designs synthesized with the Altera Quartus II University Interface Program tool. Additionally, we found that the average segment length in an FPGA routing channel should decrease with technology scaling. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of TORCH by illustrating how TORCH can be used to optimize other aspects of the routing architecture in an FPGA.","0278-0070;1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2010.2061530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580223","Design exploration;FPGA;routing architecture;stochastic","Switches;Routing;Field programmable gate arrays;Delay;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing","field programmable gate arrays;network routing;stochastic processes","FPGA routing architecture;field-programmable gate array;stochastic methods;tool for optimizing routing architecture software;versatile place;route tool;routing channel segmentation;switch box patterns;average interconnect power-delay product;incremental routing;infrequent placement;multimodal move selection;parallelized metric evaluation;Altera Quartus II University interface program tool","","3","37","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus far, most implementations have been software-based, limiting their speed and power efficiency. Integrated photonics offers the potential for a fast, power efficient and massively parallel hardware implementation. We have previously proposed a network of coupled semiconductor optical amplifiers as an interesting test case for such a hardware implementation. In this paper, we investigate the important design parameters and the consequences of process variations through simulations. We use an isolated word recognition task with babble noise to evaluate the performance of the photonic reservoirs with respect to traditional software reservoir implementations, which are based on leaky hyperbolic tangent functions. Our results show that the use of coherent light in a well-tuned reservoir architecture offers significant performance benefits. The most important design parameters are the delay and the phase shift in the system's physical connections. With optimized values for these parameters, coherent semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) reservoirs can achieve better results than traditional simulated reservoirs. We also show that process variations hardly degrade the performance, but amplifier noise can be detrimental. This effect must therefore be taken into account when designing SOA-based RC implementations.","1045-9227;1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2161771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5966352","Integrated optics;optical neural networks;photonic reservoir computing;semiconductor optical amplifiers;speech recognition","Reservoirs;Photonics;Neurons;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Topology;Speech recognition;Network topology","learning (artificial intelligence);optical neural nets;parallel processing;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;semiconductor optical amplifiers","parallel reservoir computing;coupled semiconductor optical amplifiers;neural systems;complex recognition problems;complex classification problems;photonic reservoirs;babble noise;performance evaluation;software reservoir;simulated reservoirs;amplifier noise;recurrent neural networks;optical neural networks;leaky hyperbolic tangent functions;isolated word recognition task","Amplifiers, Electronic;Computer Simulation;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Noise;Optical Devices;Pattern Recognition, Physiological;Semiconductors;Spectrum Analysis;Speech Recognition Software","56","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditionally, such applications have been realized on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and/or digital signal processors (DSP). However, ASICs' advantage in performance and power often could not justify the fast increasing fabrication cost, while current DSP offers a limited processing throughput that is usually lower than 100GFLOPS. On the other hand, current multi-core processors, especially graphics processing units (GPUs), deliver very high computing throughput, and at the same time maintain high flexibility and programmability. It is thus appealing to study the potential of GPUs for high performance embedded computing. In this work, we perform a comprehensive performance evaluation on GPUs with the high performance embedded computing (HPEC) benchmark suite, which consist a broad range of signal processing benchmarks with an emphasis on radar processing applications. We develop efficient GPU implementations that could outperform previous results for all the benchmarks. In addition, a systematic instruction level analysis for the GPU implementations is conducted with a GPU micro-architecture simulator. The results provide key insights on optimizing GPU hardware and software. Meanwhile, we also compared the performance and power efficiency between GPU and DSP with the HPEC benchmarks.

A Matlab-based system assists the investigation of the impact of very rare decoding failure events on the FEC system performance and the finding of solutions which aim to parameters optimization and BER performance improvement of LDPC codes in the error floor region.

There are many factors that can cause or contribute to the damage of the top layer of concrete in bridge decks including the corrosion of steel rebar, freeze and thaw cycles, traffic loading, initial damage resulting from poor design and/or construction, and inadequate maintenance. When applied to the analysis of bridge decks, GPR can be successfully used for detecting internal corrosion of steel reinforcement within the concrete deck, which can be an indicator of poor quality overlay bonding or delamination at the rebar level. Therefore, this equipment has the ability to gain information about the condition of bridge decks in a more rapid and less costly fashion than coring and will perhaps yield a more reliable assessment than current geotechnical procedures. However, this application requires suitably designed equipment; for instance, optimization of antenna orientation to take advantage of signal polarization is an important feature for successfully locating reinforcing bars in a time-depth slice. Novel equipment has recently been developed to enable the nondestructive analysis of bridge decks; the IDS RIS Hi-Bright runs two arrays of high frequency sensors featuring a rapid, but very dense data collection, thus dramatically increasing the resolution of the GPR survey. Antenna dipoles in these arrays are deployed to collect two data sets with orthogonal antenna orientations, one with the electric field parallel to the scanning direction (VV), the other perpendicular to it (HH); in this way, the equipment is capable of collecting 16 profiles, 10 cm spaced in a single swath, thus collecting an incredible amount of information. Dedicated data analysis software provides a 2-D tomography of the underground layers and a 3-D view of the surveyed volume. Main output include the determination of pavement and concrete thickness, the detection of moist areas as well as concrete damage and the location of rebars and ducts within the concrete slab.","","978-1-4673-2663-6978-1-4673-2662-9978-1-4673-2661","10.1109/ICGPR.2012.6254915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6254915","GPR;bridge;corrosion;delamination","Ground penetrating radar;Conferences","bridges (structures);concrete;condition monitoring;corrosion;dipole antennas;ducts;electric fields;electromagnetic wave polarisation;foundations;fracture;freezing;geotechnical engineering;ground penetrating radar;inspection;maintenance engineering;melting;nondestructive testing;radar antennas;radar resolution;rebar;slabs;steel;structural engineering;surveying","bridge deck;high resolution ground penetrating radar;structure surveying;civil engineering application;condition assessment;highway pavement;foundation;structural concrete;inspection;corrosion detection;steel rebar;freeze cycle;thaw cycle;traffic loading;maintenance;GPR;steel reinforcement;concrete deck;rebar level;reliable assessment;geotechnical procedure;optimization;signal polarization;reinforcing bar;nondestructive analysis;IDS RIS Hi-Bright;high frequency sensor;antenna dipole;orthogonal antenna orientation;electric field;scanning direction;data analysis software;2D tomography;underground layer;3D view;concrete thickness;moist area detection;concrete damage;ducts;concrete slab;distance 10 cm","","5","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hydro-thermal optimal scheduling is formulated by the optimization of generation, maintenance plans and the water level. According to different scenarios of runoff, scenario tree model is established, while ensuring that optimization variables of all the forecast scenarios can satisfy the various constraints. For the complexity of the established model, based on integer algebraic model techniques, auxiliary state variables and associated constraints are introduced, and then the model is converted to a linear mixed integer programming problem. With the help of advanced GAMS model software, simulation system is established. Finally, using CPLEX solver, the scheme of hydro-thermal plants optimal operation is formatted.

Our approach determines the magnitude of cost excess for nodes in an application's call graph so that cloud developers can better understand where to focus their efforts to lower costs (or deem some excesses acceptable based on business case analysis).","","978-1-4673-2284-3978-1-4673-2282-9978-1-4673-2283","10.1109/IRI.2012.6303027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6303027","","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Business;Weight measurement;Real time systems","cloud computing;data flow graphs;program diagnostics;program verification;software cost estimation","cost excessive path;cloud based service;pay-as-you-go economic model;cloud computing;earn-as-you-go profit model;cost optimization;verification;cloud application testing;monetary cost objective;static analysis approach;control flow path;cost threshold;worst case execution time analysis;processing time;bandwidth cost;storage cost;service cost;application call graph;cloud developer;business case analysis","","1","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, there are three requirements in the process of image registration when using these approaches. First, the algorithm is apt to be influenced by illumination. Second, algorithm should have less computational complexity. Third, the depth information of images needs to be estimated without other sensors. This paper investigates a famous local invariant feature named speeded up robust feature (SURF), and proposes a highspeed and robust image registration and localization algorithm based on it. With supports from feature tracking and pose estimation methods, the proposed algorithm can compute camera poses under different conditions of scale, viewpoint and rotation so as to precisely localize object's position. At last, the study makes registration experiment by scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), SURF and the proposed algorithm, and designs a method to evaluate their performances. Furthermore, this study makes object retrieval test on remote sensing video. For there is big deformation on remote sensing frames, the registration algorithm absorbs the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) 3-D coplanar calibration feature tracker methods, which can localize interesting targets precisely and efficiently. The experimental results prove that the proposed method has a higher localization speed and lower localization error rate than traditional visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) in a period of time.","1004-4132","","10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2010.03.026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6073147","local invariant features;speeded up robust feature (SURF);Harris corner;Kanada-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) transform;Coplanar camera calibration algorithm;landmarks","Feature extraction;Cameras;Robustness;Image registration;Remote sensing;Lighting;Transmission line matrix methods","","","","1","","","","","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

As supply voltage falls, thereby saving dynamic power, the impact of threshold voltage on delay becomes greater so that it will become increasingly difficult to set a fixed threshold voltage that optimizes both performance and static power. This paper proposes a method around these conflicting requirements by allowing threshold voltages to be dynamically adjusted at run time via back-gate control on thin-body double-gate Silicon on Insulator (TBDGSOI) transistors. Using a multi-level simulation approach, with SPICE and VHDL-AMS, and using a small RISC microprocessor architecture as an example, it is shown that reductions in subthreshold leakage of between 6X and 11X can be achieved using this run-time control technique under a number of small software workloads.","","978-1-4244-6026-7978-1-4244-6025-0978-0-7695-3978","10.1109/DELTA.2010.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438682","low power computer architecture;double gate;SOI;VHDL-AMS;modeling","Subthreshold current;Threshold voltage;Embedded system;Delay;Voltage control;Silicon on insulator technology;SPICE;Reduced instruction set computing;Microprocessors;Computer architecture","hardware description languages;silicon-on-insulator;SPICE;transistors","run-time control;subthreshold current;double-gate device technology;back-gate control;thin-body double-gate silicon on insulator transistors;SPICE;VHDL-AMS;RISC microprocessor architecture;run-time control technique","","","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The TRMS and similar manoeuvring systems are often subjected to random disturbances arising from various sources such as driving motors and external environmental sources. For such highly nonlinear systems with varying operating conditions, adaptive control approaches are suitable tools to cope with plant uncertainties. A model inverse control of the TRMS is developed using on-line ANFIS learning algorithm. The consequent and antecedent parameters of a first order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system are optimised on-line using recursive least squares and gradient descent algorithms, respectively. The optimal initialization of the ANFIS parameters is achieved through an off-line training process.

There are various ways of calculating no-load losses of transformers based on empirical formulas and experimentally obtained coefficients but these tend to mostly apply to known and tested core designs. The most important factors that contribute to the no-load loss of transformer cores are the grade of steel used, the core and corner geometry and stacking configuration. This paper presents re- sults and analysis for a 100 kVA, 3-phase model transformer core, consisting of 11 packets of different width laminations, over a range of flux densities up to 1.8 T. The results show the average magnetic flux desnity across the core cross section as well as the magnetic flux density of the individual packets. Using this information in combination with the magnetising current the no-load loss can be derived for the whole core as well as for the individual packets. The paper also shows numerical calculations of the excitation current required to magnetise the core. The FEA software used was developed in ALSTOM and allows the calculation of flux density distribution as well as the determination of the magnetising current necessary to magnetise the core at different flux density levels. It is believed that the combination of measurements and FE modelling will enable the calculation of local power loss thus allowing for optimisation of the various core parameters.","0018-9464;1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2011.2173667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172357","Magnetic flux density;magnetic losses;magnetic cores;transformer cores","Transformer cores;Loss measurement;Magnetic flux;Current measurement;Magnetic domains;Density measurement","eddy current losses;finite element analysis;laminations;magnetic flux;parameter estimation;transformer cores","flux density distribution;transformer no-load loss measurement;transformer no-load loss calculation;core designs;core geometry;corner geometry;stacking configuration;three-phase model transformer core;laminations;average magnetic flux desnity;excitation current;numerical calculations;FEA software;magnetising current determination;local power loss calculation;core parameter optimisation","","9","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Crafting the core of such a system in a way that achieves flexibility, security, and performance requires a careful balancing act. Simple static primitives with hard partitions of space and time are easier to analyze formally, but strict approaches to the problem at the hardware level have been extremely restrictive, failing to allow even the simplest of dynamic behaviors to be expressed. Our approach to this problem is to construct a minimal but configurable architectural skeleton. This skeleton couples a critical slice of the low level hardware implementation with a microkernel in a way that allows information flow properties of the entire construction to be statically verified all the way down to its gate-level implementation. This strict structure is then made usable by a runtime system that delivers more traditional services (e.g. communication interfaces and long-living contexts) in a way that is decoupled from the information flow properties of the skeleton. To test the viability of this approach we design, test, and statically verify the information-flow security of a hardware/software system complete with support for unbounded operation, inter-process communication, pipelined operation, and I/O with traditional devices. The resulting system is provably sound even when adversaries are allowed to execute arbitrary code on the machine, yet is flexible enough to allow caching, pipelining, and other common case optimizations.","1063-6897;1063-6897","978-1-4503-0472-6978-1-4503-0472-6978-1-4503-0472","10.1145/2000064.2000087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6307757","High Assurance Systems;Gate Level Information Flow Tracking;Non-interference","Security;Kernel;Logic gates;Hardware;Skeleton;Registers","cache storage;hardware-software codesign;pipeline processing;security of data","microkernel;processor;I-O system;information flow security;high assurance systems;static primitives;dynamic behaviors;architectural skeleton;gate-level implementation;runtime system;skeleton information flow properties;hardware-software system;unbounded operation;interprocess communication;pipelined operation;arbitrary code execution;caching;pipelining","","21","34","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike the conventional evolutionary algorithms that depend on predefined probability distribution function for mutation process, differential evolution uses the differences of randomly sampled pairs of objective vectors for its mutation process. The Due to the increasing interest on renewable sources in recent times, the studies on integration of distributed generation to the power grid have rapidly increased. The distributed generation (DG) sources are added to the network mainly to reduce the power losses by supplying a net amount of power. In order to minimize the line losses of power systems, it is equally important to define the size and location of local generation.

Our study shows that: (1) Excessive logistics delay may affect the stability of the system; (2) The stability and performance of the support system of spare parts based on the ""demand-pull"" model are closely related to the supply chain management system and technical conditions, also depend on the interactions of multiple factors. Then we get the value threshold of the key parameters to make the system stable, and test the impacts of logistics delay on the stability of the system. Finally, through system dynamics simulation, we optimize the system.","","978-1-61284-486-2978-1-61284-485-5978-1-61284-484","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6014397","spare parts;system dynamics;organizational level;support system","Analytical models;Oscillators","logistics;maintenance engineering;supply chain management","demand-pull model;spare parts support system;spare parts logistics;feedback control mechanism;supply-demand model;system dynamics;supply chain management system","","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these algorithms have several deficiencies, evicting less frequent clean page is too slow, the grain of implementation is coarse, and experiments are not very comprehensive. We suggest a novel algorithm called AML which means Adaptively Mixed List. AML prefers to evict the cold clean page and changes the window size adaptively according to the history of access patterns.

Road discretization treatment is introduced, simplifying the calculations and reducing the solution difficulty. Two criteria are set up in terms of response capability and deterrent capability for the judgment of a patrol scheme. A modified greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-objective model.

FLEXOR is designed to accommodate many different applications and services for wireless sensor networks and foster code re-usability and cross-platform component re-usability. FLEXOR offers high modularity, well defined interfaces, remote node management functionality as well as run-time module exchange.

This aspect of vehicle customer perception is called âdrivabilityâ. To meet these objectives, a co-simulation platform has been developed between models under LMS-AMESim<sup>Â®</sup>and Matlab/Simulink<sup>Â®</sup>. The first model represents the physical characteristics of the vehicle with LMS-AMESim<sup>Â®</sup>and takes into account stiffness of the driveline, motor block behaviour onto its mounting blocks, suspensions, tires and vehicle dynamics. The second model computes the torque command of the electric motor for drivability manoeuvres as well as for driving cycles with Matlab/Simulink<sup>Â®</sup>. This paper shows how this platform can help integration teams to tune software and hardware parameters from the early steps of the project's design. Concerning the software, any torque setpoint strategy can be integrated in order to filter the shocks amplitude during tip-in. The impact of an RST filter on the vehicle response is studied; moreover, this study shows that the vehicle range can be added to classical optimization criteria such as time response and overshoot. For the hardware side of this platform, the very good correlation of the model's acceleration with track tests gives a high level of trust in the sensitivity study of most influents parameters on the drivability rating, which is assessed by some objectives criteria on vehicle acceleration.","1948-3457;1948-3449;1948-3449","978-1-4244-5195-1978-1-4244-5196","10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524381","","Electric vehicles;Mathematical model;Vehicle driving;Torque;Hardware;Filters;Life estimation;Suspensions;Tires;Vehicle dynamics","electric motors;electric vehicles;optimisation;road vehicles;vehicle dynamics","electric vehicle;vehicle customer perception;drivability analysis;LMS-AMESim;Matlab;Simulink;electric motor torque command;torque setpoint strategy;RST filter;optimization criteria;vehicle acceleration","","4","9","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For ranked retrieval in a collection of objects based on series of multivariate observations (e.g., searching similar video clips to a query example), satisfactory performance cannot be achieved by using many conventional similarity measures that aggregate element-to-element comparison results. Some correlation information among the individual elements has also been investigated to characterize each set of multidimensional points for comparison, but with an unwarranted assumption that the underlying data distribution has a particular parametric form. Motivated by these concerns, measuring the similarity of multidimensional point sets is approached from a novel collective perspective in this paper, by evaluating the probability that they are consistent with a same distribution. We propose to make use of nonparametric hypothesis tests in statistics to compute the distributional discrepancy of samples for assessing the degree of similarity between two ensembles of points. While our proposal is mainly presented in the context of video similarity search, it enjoys great flexibility and is extensible to other applications where multidimensional point set representations are involved, such as motion capture retrieval.","1520-9210;1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2010.2085424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597949","Distributional discrepancy;hypothesis tests;multi dimensional point set;nonparametric;similarity measures","Principal component analysis;Australia;Proposals;Correlation;Materials;Electrical engineering;Scattering","motion estimation;multimedia computing;set theory;video retrieval","exploring distributional discrepancy;multidimensional point set retrieval;multimedia applications;multivariate observations;video clips;element-to-element comparison;correlation information;unwarranted assumption;data distribution;video similarity search;motion capture retrieval","","2","36","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, currently available strategies generally rely on virtual sampling, leaving open the question of how many samples are necessary, on the use of invariant feature representations, which can mistakenly discard information relevant to the vision task, or on the use of latent variable models, which result in non-convex training and expensive inference at test time. We propose here a generalization of structured output SVM regressors that can incorporate equivariance and invariance into a convex training procedure, enabling the incorporation of large families of transformations, while maintaining optimality and tractability. Importantly, test time inference does not require the estimation of latent variables, resulting in highly efficient objective functions. This results in a natural formulation for treating equivariance and invariance that is easily implemented as an adaptation of off-the-shelf optimization software, obviating the need for ad hoc sampling strategies.

The aim is to improve forklift dispatching and reduce the costs associated with the delays of loading/unloading delivery trucks. To that end, an integrated system including both hardware and software is constructed. First, the forklifts are instrumented with sensor nodes that collect an array of information, including the forklifts' physical location, usage time, bumping/collision history, and battery status. The hardware's capability is enhanced with a theoretically sound hypothesis testing technique to capture the rather elusive location information, and the collection of the data is done in an efficient event-driven manner. The information acquired combined with inventory information is fed into a sophisticated actor-critic type stochastic learning method to generate dispatching recommendations. Because noise is inevitable in such wireless sensor networks, the performance of the algorithm is investigated under different noise levels.

However, power is still a major concern for any mobile device, and requires optimization of power consumption using a power model for each multimedia application, such as a video decoder. In this paper, a generic decoding complexity model for the motion compensation (MC) process, which constitutes up to 25% of the computational complexity and hence power consumption of an H.264/AVC decoder, has been proposed. For the model to remain independent from a specific implementation or platform, it has been developed by analysing the MC algorithm as described in the standard. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model estimates MC complexity with an average accuracy of 95.63%, for a wide range of test sequences using both JM and x.264 software implementations of H.264/AVC. For a dedicated hardware implementation of the MC module the modeling accuracy is around 89.61%, according to our simulation results. It should be noted that in addition to power consumption control, the proposed model can be used for designing a receiver-aware H.264/AVC encoder, where the complexity constraints of the receiver side are taken into account during compression.","1945-788X;1945-7871;1945-7871","978-1-4673-1659-0978-0-7695-4711","10.1109/ICME.2012.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298521","Decoder complexity modeling;H.264/AVC decoding;motion compensation","Complexity theory;Decoding;Interpolation;Computational modeling;Video coding;Estimation error;Software","computational complexity;data compression;motion compensation;power consumption;telecommunication power supplies;video coding","motion compensation process;H.264-AVC video coding standard;computing technology;communication technology;ubiquitous access;high-quality multimedia content;high-definition video;smart phones;net books;tablets;mobile device;power consumption optimization;power model;video decoder;generic decoding complexity model;MC process;computational complexity;H.264-AVC decoder;MC complexity estimation;JM implementation;x.264 software implementation;power consumption control;receiver-aware H.264-AVC encoder;data compression","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The clustering information is contained on the eigendecomposition of a modified similarity matrix derived from the data. This eigenvalue problem corresponds to the dual solution of a primal optimization problem formulated in a high-dimensional feature space. A model selection criterion called the balanced line fit (BLF) is also proposed. This criterion is based on the out-of-sample extension and exploits the structure of the eigenvectors and the corresponding projections when the clusters are well formed.

However, the degree of difficulty increases dramatically with an increasing number of students and courses for which the scheduling shall be carried out. From the mathematical point of view this is a âhardâ problem, since the runtime on a computer cannot be estimated by a simple law (i.e. by a polynomial law) by the number of parameters. These kinds of problems are called âNP hardâ. There are three important versions of the timetabling problem at universities, known as the university timetabling problem, i.e. curriculum-based course timetabling, post-enrollment timetabling and examination timetabling. All specified problems are important for room management at universities, for the realization of courses that can be studied according to curricula, and for the satisfaction of students and teachers. These problems are related to the optimization of room management and personnel costs (e.g. by a uniform distribution of students). Thus, the solution to these problems is related to the optimization of ârealâ costs, a more and more important economic factor at (German) universities. Introduction of the two-tiered Bachelor and Master courses has raised awareness for these problems at German universities: due to the multitude of new courses the timetables which have been established and stood the test of time cannot be used any longer. Moreover classes tend to be more structured and have strong similarities to classical school situations; attendance is compulsory and dependencies between modules determine the feasibility of the curricula. This feasibility is also evaluated while accrediting new study courses. Since 2003, we have been using using an algorithm that has been realized by members of our team for the solution of the post-enrollment-based course timetabling problem at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. For classes with more than 2000 enrolled students, organization by itself is a challenge; problems may include splitting of those classes into several separate lectures, arranging the associated tutorials into small groups of students, allocating adequate rooms, and scheduling examinations. Moreover, homework and exams need to be administered, whereby, depending on the field of study, very different rules are to be obeyed. This especially pertains to the Department of Mathematics because it offers most of the compulsory classes in mathematics for all fields of study held at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. These are the biggest classes at the university and are to be attended by the majority of students. Thus, the Moses (Mobile Services for Students)-Account has been being developed and used since 2004. This web-based software allows students to enroll in tutorials with a list of preferences for given dates. A special algorithm, providing a globally optimized (with respect to the students' wishes and resources available) solution, processes all registrations.","2165-9559;2165-9567","978-1-4244-6571-2978-1-4244-6568-2978-1-4244-6569-9978-1-4244-6570","10.1109/EDUCON.2010.5492433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492433","university timetabling;academic administration;integer programming;NP-completeness","Educational institutions;Mathematics;Cost function;Linear algebra;Engineering management;Mechanical engineering;Processor scheduling;Runtime;Polynomials;Personnel","computational complexity;educational administrative data processing;educational courses;educational institutions;optimisation","university timetabling;curriculum-based course timetabling;post-enrollment timetabling;examination timetabling;room management;cost optimization;bachelor courses;Master course;German university;NP hard problem","","3","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Optimized versions of the KLIMA-IASI code have been investigated, aiming at developing a non-operation retrieval code with capabilities that meet the requirements of cross validation with GOSAT TANSO-FTS products and with adequate features for the integration on the G-POD system. The KLIMA algorithm consists of two distinct modules: the Forward Model and the Retrieval Model, optimized for inverse processing of IASI measurements. The Forward Model is a line-by-line radiative transfer model, with capability to simulate wideband spectral radiances acquired by IASI. The adopted spectroscopic database is HITRAN 2008. Dedicated spectroscopic database and line shape are implemented for CO<sub>2</sub>, to take into account the line-mixing effect (Niro et al., 2005). The Retrieval Model uses a constrained Nonlinear Least Square Fit approach and the cost function to be minimized takes into account the a priori information (Optimal Estimation Method) and the Marquardt parameter. To reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties, this module implements a multi-target retrieval (more than one species is simultaneously retrieved) and a complete variance-covariance matrix (VCM), including both the measurement errors and the errors in the estimate of FM parameters. For the performance of the retrieval a target accuracy of 0.3% (1 ppmv out of 370 ppmv) on regional scales (1000 Ã 1000 km) at monthly intervals, which is consistent with the requirements of the GOSAT mission for CO<sub>2</sub>products, was assumed as reference value. The required maximum program size was set to one Gbyte and the running time was limited with the aim of processing one orbit of IASI data in one day when using G-POD computing resources. The KLIMA-IASI ARM algorithm has been successfully integrated in the ESA G-POD for Earth Observation Application and now the code is available to all interested users for bulk processing of IASI data. ESA G-POD is a GRID based-operational environment, accessible using a dedicated Web portal (http://gpod.eo.esa.int/). It hosts more than 350 local computing nodes, more than 500 TB of EO data coming from ESA and non-ESA satellites. The full capacity of G-POD computing resources, that can be made available for KLIMA-IASI bulk processing, are currently under evaluation; moreover the upload of the full set of IASI data acquired in one year (march 2010 - march 2011) shall be completed (3 months are available at the moment). After the procurement of a consolidated version of the KLIMA-IASI/G- POD retrieval code it was possible to start the processing of IASI spectra and for comparison and cross-validation of KLIMA-IASI CO<sub>2</sub>products with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS operational products. Using the KLIMA inversion code integrated into the ESA G-POD, it was possible to perform an extensive inter-comparison and cross-validation of a selected set of IASI measurements collocated with GOSAT TANSO-FTS observations. The KLIMA-IASI code was used for the retrieval of CO<sub>2</sub>total column from a series of test cases for comparison with GOSAT TANSO-FTS SWIR L2 data. Retrieved values from measurements acquired by the two instruments in February 2011 in two selected areas between 25-45Â°N over Nord America and Asia are shown in figures 1-2, along with maps of the footprints of IASI (red crosses) and GOSAT (green crosses) Field of Views.","2153-7003;2153-6996;2153-6996","978-1-4673-1159-5978-1-4673-1160-1978-1-4673-1158","10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6350629","","Extraterrestrial measurements;Air pollution;Atmospheric measurements;Databases;Geophysical measurements;Software algorithms;Software","atmospheric composition;atmospheric techniques;carbon compounds;covariance matrices;data analysis;geophysics computing;grid computing;inverse problems;portals;radiative transfer;spectral analysis","KLIMA/G-POD algorithm;CO2retrieval;IASI/METOP-A observation;GOSAT/TANSO-FTS product;ESA research project;KLIMA inversion algorithm;IFAC-CNR;ESA Earth Explorer Mission;ESA GRID-based operational environment;grid processing on-demand;Level-1 data processing;IASI instrument;METOP-A satellite;GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level-2 data;nonoperation retrieval code;forward model;retrieval model;inverse processing;line-by-line radiative transfer model;wideband spectral radiance;spectroscopic database;HITRAN 2008;line shape;line-mixing effect;constrained nonlinear least square fit approach;cost function minimization;optimal estimation method;Marquardt parameter;systematic uncertainty;multitarget retrieval;variance-covariance matrix;VCM;measurement error;GOSAT mission;G-POD computing resource;KLIMA-IASI ARM algorithm;ESA G-POD;Earth observation application;Web portal;computing node;AD 2011 02;North America;Asia;CO2","","","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, if the primary signal is received with a strong line of sight component, its relaying from the secondary transmitter does not suffice to ensure the primary user quality of service.

This emphasises the importance of the memory access scheduling to efficiently utilize memory bandwidth. Moreover, in recent micro-processors, multithread and multicore is turned to be the default choice for their design. This resulted in more contention on memory. Hence, the effect of memory access scheduling schemes is more critical to the overall performance boost. Although memory access scheduling techniques have been recently proposed for performance improvement, most of them have overlooked the fairness among the running applications. Achieving both high-throughput and fairness simultaneously is challenging. In this paper, we focus on the basic idea of memory requests scheduling, which includes how to assign priorities to threads, what request should be served first, and how to achieve fairness among the running applications for multicore microprocessors. We propose two new memory access scheduling techniques FLRMR, and FIQMR. Compared to recently proposed techniques, on average, FLRMR achieves 8.64% speedup relative to LREQ algorithm, and FIQMR achieves 11.34% speedup relative to IQ-based algorithm. FLRMR outperforms the best of the other techniques by 8.1% in 8-cores workloads.

However, the generic morphological erosion and dilation operation in the CUDA NPP library is relatively naive, and performance scales expensively with increasing structuring element size. The objective of this work is to produce a freely available GPU capability for morphological operations so that fast GPU processing can be readily available to those in the morphological image processing community. Open-source extensions to CUDA (hereafter referred to as LTU-CUDA) have been produced for erosion and dilation using a number of structuring elements for both 8 bit and 32 bit images. Support for 32 bit image data is a specific objective of the work in order to facilitate fast processing of image data from 3D range sensors with high depth precision. Furthermore, the implementation specifically allows scalability of image size and structuring element size for processing of large image sets. Images up to 4096 by 4096 pixels with 32 bit precision were tested. This scalability has been achieved by forgoing the use of shared memory in CUDA multiprocessors. The vHGW algorithm for erosion and dilation independent of structuring element size has been implemented for horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree line structuring elements with significant performance improvements over NPP. However, memory handling limitations hinder performance in the vertical line case providing results not independent of structuring element size and posing an interesting challenge for further optimisation. This performance limitation is mitigated for larger structuring elements using an optimised transpose function, which is not default in NPP, and applying the horizontal structuring element.

To explore the relationship between classification error, controller delay, and real-time controllability, 13 able-bodied subjects were trained to operate a virtual upper-limb prosthesis using pattern recognition of electromyogram (EMG) signals. Classification error and controller delay were varied by training different classifiers with a variety of analysis window lengths ranging from 50 to 550 ms and either two or four EMG input channels. Offline analysis showed that classification error decreased with longer window lengths ( <i>p</i> &lt;; 0.01). Real-time controllability was evaluated with the target achievement control (TAC) test, which prompted users to maneuver the virtual prosthesis into various target postures. The results indicated that user performance improved with lower classification error (<i>p</i> &lt;; 0.01 ) and was reduced with longer controller delay ( <i>p</i> &lt;; 0.01), as determined by the window length. Therefore, both of these effects should be considered when choosing a window length; it may be beneficial to increase the window length if this results in a reduced classification error, despite the corresponding increase in controller delay. For the system employed in this study, the optimal window length was found to be between 150 and 250 ms , which is within acceptable controller delays for conventional multistate amplitude controllers.","1534-4320;1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2100828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676233","Controller delay;myoelectric control;pattern recognition;prosthesis;surface electromyography","Delay;Pattern recognition;Electromyography;Classification algorithms;Real time systems;Prosthetics;Controllability","electromyography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;pattern classification;prosthetics;real-time systems","optimal window length;pattern recognition;myoelectric control;competing effects;classification error;controller delay;myoelectric prosthesis;virtual upper-limb prosthesis;electromyogram signals;EMG;target achievement control testing;conventional multistate amplitude controllers","Algorithms;Artificial Limbs;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrodes;Electromyography;Electrophysiological Phenomena;Humans;Linear Models;Muscle, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Prosthesis Design;Software;User-Computer Interface","125","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, competition-based motion vector prediction has proved its efficiency. However, the targeted 50% bitrate saving for equivalent quality is not yet achieved. In this context, this paper proposes to reduce the signaling information resulting from this motion vector competition, by using data hiding techniques. As data hiding and video compression traditionally have contradictory goals, an advanced study of data hiding schemes is first performed. Then, an original way of using data hiding for video compression is proposed. The main idea of this paper is to hide the competition index into appropriately selected chroma and luma transform coefficients. To minimize the prediction errors, the transform coefficients modification is performed via a rate-distortion optimization. The proposed scheme is evaluated on several low and high resolution sequences. Objective improvements (up to 2.40% bitrate saving) and subjective assessment of the chroma loss are reported.","1051-8215;1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2130330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734824","Chroma and luma samples;competition index signalization;data hiding;H.264/AVC;video coding","Indexes;Transforms;Bit rate;Video compression;Encoding;Automatic voltage control;Rate-distortion","data compression;data encapsulation;rate distortion theory;video coding","rate distortion data hiding;motion vector competition information;video compression;JCT-VC experts group;H.264/AVC;JM key technical area software;video coding test model;competition index;chroma transform coefficients;luma transform coefficients;rate-distortion optimization;chroma loss","","4","24","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A client-side API split files into redundant chunks, which are encoded/decoded, anonymized, and distributed to different storage locations in parallel by using multistream pipeline. A chunk placement engine on the server-side API receives/delivers chunks from/to the client side API. In this model, the user preserves her files in-house and achieves data availability anytime from anywhere even in site failure scenarios while the organizations preserves the control of their storage resources. The experimental evaluation reveals the middleware can compensate the overhead produced on the client side by taking advantage of multiple cores commonly found in user's devices. The users observe that the middleware produces similar performance to the private and public file hosting systems tested in the evaluation. The organizations observe a significant reduction of work in their servers.

"Efficient Online RTL Debugging Methodology for Logic Emulation Systems","S. Banerjee; T. Gupta","NA; NA","2012 25th International Conference on VLSI Design","","2012","","","298","303","The offline debugging model provided by logic emulation systems has some specific disadvantages. Since analysis of signal traces and bug fixing is decoupled from emulation run, validation of a potential fix requires a costly iteration through design recompilation and mapping process, followed by fresh emulation run. This slows down overall verification process. This paper presents an online debugging methodology to achieve rapid verification closure with capability to execute the design back and forward for debug. On encountering an error, the design under test (DUT) can be reverse executed step-by-step to locate source of the error. A two pass emulation technique is used to generate checkpoints and traces needed to support reverse execution. Easy and efficient reverse execution based debug is supported using an innovative technique called optimized design slicing, which allows debug along a meaningful design portion likely to cause the error being investigated. Once the source of error is located, potential bug fixes can be evaluated online by forcing a set of signals to desired values, without going through the design recompilation process and restarting emulation from time 0. Benchmarks on several customer designs have shown that the methodology enhances verification performance significantly.","2380-6923;1063-9667;1063-9667","978-1-4673-0438-2978-0-7695-4638","10.1109/VLSID.2012.87","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6167768","Emulation;Debugging","Emulation;Clocks;Debugging;Software;Force;Logic gates;Hardware design languages","integrated circuit modelling;iterative methods;logic circuits","online RTL debugging methodology;logic emulation systems;costly iteration through design recompilation;mapping process;online debugging methodology;design under test;DUT;two pass emulation technique;optimized design slicing","","3","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach is framed in the GAMES (Green Active Management of Energy in IT Service centres) EU Project1 about green IT. In this paper, we define four clusters of Green Metrics enabling to feature an application in terms of the energy it consumes at run time.

Contrary to this popular belief, we present RM workloads for which conventional parallel implementations scale poorly on multi-core platforms. We identify off-chip memory transfers and overheads in the parallel runtime library as the primary bottlenecks that limit speedups to be well below the ideal linear speedup expected for data-parallel workloads. To achieve improved parallel scalability, we identify and exploit several interesting properties of RM workloads - sparsity of model updates, low spatial locality among model updates, presence of insignificant computations, and the inherently self-healing nature of these algorithms in the presence of errors. We leverage these domain-specific characteristics to improve parallel scalability in two major ways. First, we utilize data dependency relaxation to simultaneously execute multiple training iterations in parallel, thereby increasing the granularity of the parallel tasks and significantly lowering the run-time overheads of fine-grained threading. Second, we strategically drop selected computations that are insignificant to the accuracy of the final result, but account for a disproportionately large amount of off-chip (memory and coherence) traffic. Through the application of the proposed techniques, we show that much higher speedups are possible on multi-core platforms for two important RM applications - document search using semantic indexing, and eye detection in images using generalized learning vector quantization. On an 8-core platform, we achieve application speedups of 5.5X and 7.3X compared to sequential implementations. Compared to conventional parallel implementations of these applications using Intel's TBB, the proposed techniques result in 4.3X and 4.9X improvements. Although the optimized parallel implementations are not numerically equivalent to the sequential implementations, the output quality is shown to be comparable (and within the margin of variation produced by processing the input data in a different order). We also explore error mitigation techniques that can be used to ensure that the accuracy of results is not compromised.","1530-2075;1530-2075","978-1-4244-6443-2978-1-4244-6442-5978-1-4244-6441","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470469","Best-effort computing;Parallel computing;Parallel programming;Recognition;Mining;Multi-core;Dependency relaxation","Parallel processing;Concurrent computing;Scalability;Application software;Vector quantization;Iterative algorithms;National electric code;Laboratories;Computer science;Testing","parallel processing;parallel programming","scalable parallel execution;recognition workload;mining workload;parallel computing platform;multi-core platform;off-chip memory transfer;parallel runtime library;data-parallel workload;parallel scalability;data dependency relaxation;document search;semantic indexing;eye detection;generalized learning vector quantization;optimized parallel implementation","","7","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Earlier hardware implementations suffer from major drawbacks such as absence of GA parameter programmability, rigid predefined system architecture, and lack of support for multiple fitness functions. In this paper, we report the design of an IP core that implements a general-purpose GA engine that addresses these problems. Specifically, the proposed GA IP core can be customized in terms of the population size, number of generations, crossover and mutation rates, random number generator seed, and the fitness function. It has been successfully synthesized and verified on a Xilinx Virtex II Pro Field programmable gate arrays device (xc2vp30-7ff896) with only 13% logic slice utilization, 1% block memory utilization for GA memory, and a clock speed of 50 MHz. The GA core has been used as a search engine for real-time adaptive healing but can be tailored to any given application by interfacing with the appropriate application-specific fitness evaluation module as well as the required storage memory and by programming the values of the desired GA parameters. The core is soft in nature i.e., a gate-level netlist is provided which can be readily integrated with the user's system. The performance of the GA core was tested using standard optimization test functions. In the hardware experiments, the proposed core either found the globally optimum solution or found a solution that was within 3.7% of the value of the globally optimal solution. The experimental test setup including the GA core achieved a speedup of around 5.16Ã over an analogous software implementation.","1089-778X;1089-778X;1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2009.2025032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299091","Evolvable hardware;field programmable gate arrays;genetic algorithm;IP core","Field programmable gate arrays;Genetic algorithms;Engines;Hardware;Random number generation;Programmable logic arrays;Testing;Genetic mutations;Logic devices;Clocks","field programmable gate arrays;genetic algorithms;real-time systems","customizable FPGA IP core;general-purpose genetic algorithm engine;hardware implementation;optimization engines;real-time application;GA parameter programmability;system architecture;multiple fitness functions;Xilinx Virtex II Pro;field programmable gate arrays device;real-time adaptive healing;application-specific fitness evaluation","","42","39","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing research on checkpoint/restart mainly focuses on optimizing checkpoint operation, without paying much attention to the restart operation. As a result, application restart latency maybe substantial, which greatly threatens system dependability and performance. To attack the restart latency problem, in this paper, we present FREM, a fast restart mechanism for general checkpoint/restart protocols. By dynamically tracking the process data accesses after each checkpoint, FREM masks restart latency by overlapping application recovery with the retrieval of its checkpoint image. We have implemented FREM as a prototype system and tested it under Linux environments. Extensive experiments with real applications demonstrate that it can effectively reduce restart latency by over 50 percent on average, as compared to the conventional restart mechanisms.","0018-9340;1557-9956;2326-3814","","10.1109/TC.2010.129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483295","Fast restart;operating system;Linux;fault tolerance;high performance computing.","Protocols;Checkpointing;Optimization;Hardware;Kernel;Computed tomography;Complexity theory","checkpointing;fault tolerant computing;Linux;software fault tolerance","fast restart mechanism;checkpoint operation;restart operation;application restart latency;system dependability;system performance;checkpoint-restart protocols;Linux;fault tolerance technique;failure rate","","7","43","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"A New Approach to Modeling Emotions and Their Use on a Decision-Making System for Artificial Agents","M. A. Salichs; M. Malfaz","Carlos III University, Leganes; Carlos III University, Leganes","IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","","2012","3","1","56","68","In this paper, a new approach to the generation and the role of artificial emotions in the decision-making process of autonomous agents (physical and virtual) is presented. The proposed decision-making system is biologically inspired and it is based on drives, motivations, and emotions. The agent has certain needs or drives that must be within a certain range, and motivations are understood as what moves the agent to satisfy a drive. Considering that the well-being of the agent is a function of its drives, the goal of the agent is to optimize it. Currently, the implemented artificial emotions are happiness, sadness, and fear. The novelties of our approach are, on one hand, that the generation method and the role of each of the artificial emotions are not defined as a whole, as most authors do. Each artificial emotion is treated separately. On the other hand, in the proposed system it is not mandatory to predefine either the situations that must release any artificial emotion or the actions that must be executed in each case. Both the emotional releaser and the actions can be learned by the agent, as happens on some occasions in nature, based on its own experience. In order to test the decision-making process, it has been implemented on virtual agents (software entities) living in a simple virtual environment. The results presented in this paper correspond to the implementation of the decision-making system on an agent whose main goal is to learn from scratch how to behave in order to maximize its well-being by satisfying its drives or needs. The learning process, as shown by the experiments, produces very natural results. The usefulness of the artificial emotions in the decision-making system is proven by making the same experiments with and without artificial emotions, and then comparing the performance of the agent.","1949-3045;2371-9850","","10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035666","Artificial emotions;decision-making system;motivations;autonomy;learning.","Decision making;Humans;Monitoring;Robot kinematics;Animals;Appraisal","decision making;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);software agents","emotion modeling;decision-making system;artificial agent;artificial emotion;autonomous agent;drive;motivation;happiness;sadness;fear;generation method;virtual agent;software entities;virtual environment;learning process;robot","","22","40","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The basic concept of this application is that of a sensorless speed closed loop with an inner current loop using flux linkage position estimation. The voltage drop on the power devices is more significant in case of low voltage then in case of the high voltage drive. This voltage drop needs to be considered in the algorithm. Simulations and real-time experimental results given in this paper shows that the proposed position estimation method can provide accurate and continuous position information over a wide range of speeds, even in low speed applications. To ensure a sure operation, a start up algorithm is also included.

"Forecasting High Frequency Financial Time Series Using Parallel FFN with CUDA and ZeroMQ","P. Arce; C. Maureira; R. Bonvallet; C. FernÃ¡ndez","NA; NA; NA; NA","2012 9th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)","","2012","","","1","5","Feed forward neural networks (FFNs) are powerful data-modelling tools that have been used in many fields of science. Specifically in financial applications, due to the number of factors affecting the market, models with a large quantity of input features, hidden and output neurons can be obtained. In financial problems, the response time is crucial and it is necessary to have faster applications. Most of the current applications have been implemented as non-parallel software running on serial processors. In this paper we present a parallel implementation of a FFN using GPU in order to reduce response time when a new data arrives. The problem can be conveniently represented by matrix operations implemented using the CUBLAS library. It provides highly optimized linear algebra routines that take advantage of the hardware features of the GPU. The algorithm was developed in C++ and CUDA and all the input features were received using the ZeroMQ library, which was also used to publish the output features. ZeroMQ is an abstraction over system sockets that allow chunks of data to be efficiently sent therefore minimizing the overhead and system calls. The CUDA implementation was tested on a compute server with an NVIDIA M2050 GPU and an Intel Xeon X5650 2.67GHz CPU, on neural networks of increasing sizes. After comparing against a straightforward 24-thread CPU implementation using MKL, experiments show that, while still slower for small FFNs, for 1000 Ã 1000 Ã 1000 networks the GPU already outperforms the CPU.","","978-4-88552-265-9978-1-4673-2434","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379709","","Graphics processing units;Neurons;Neural networks;Libraries;Vectors;Central Processing Unit;Training","feedforward neural nets;financial data processing;linear algebra;parallel architectures;software libraries;time series","high frequency financial time series forecasting;parallel feed forward neural network;CUDA;data-modelling tool;response time reduction;matrix operation;CUBLAS library;linear algebra routine optimisation;C++;ZeroMQ library;NVIDIA M2050 GPU;Intel Xeon X5650 CPU;frequency 2.67 GHz","","1","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our research, the underlying network architecture of the internet is formalized by a model of a generalized networked control system (NCS) where the autonomous distributed information processing units are constrained by the end-to-end rule of the Internet. With the formalization, the factors of nonlinear controllers, communication channels, and communication protocols are interacted in the model based on the principles of the âsystem of systemsâ. Accordingly, the technology of âsoftware systems engineeringâ is applied to design and test the new algorithm proposed by us for the Internet flow control, which is based on the nonlinear filtering mechanism of the TCP congestion control, to provide a new Internet flow control protocol. The higher stability of the nonlinear controller for the Internet flows is observed in the experiments compared with the linear ones. The robustness of the Internet flow control is achieved even under the unexpected dynamical environment that causes the uncertainty of bandwidth, delay, and loss of the communication. In order to optimize the design of the network architecture, the corresponding analysis of the complex behavior of the flow dynamics of the Internet has been carried out. The significance of the results shows that a new design principle of the dynamics-aware protocols for the future Internet can be innovated in terms of the designed mathematical model of the âsystem of systemsâ. From our practice, it can be inferred that the performance evaluation of the Internet flow control under the cross layers can be extended to reconfigurable overlay networks.","","978-1-4673-0750-5978-1-4673-0748-2978-1-4673-0749","10.1109/SysCon.2012.6189453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189453","application of the âsystem of systemsâ;nonlinear dynamics;signal processing for communications;Internet protocol;software engineering","Internet;Computer architecture;Modeling;Robustness;Protocols;Steady-state;Delay","computer network performance evaluation;control engineering computing;distributed parameter systems;Internet;networked control systems;nonlinear control systems;overlay networks;reconfigurable architectures;telecommunication channels;telecommunication congestion control;transport protocols","system-of-systems;robustness analysis;autonomous control;dynamics-aware Internet autonomous architecture;network architecture analysis;Internet flow control protocol;performance analysis;generalized networked control system;NCS;autonomous distributed information processing;end-to-end rule;nonlinear controllers;communication channels;communication protocols;software systems engineering;nonlinear filtering mechanism;TCP congestion control;bandwidth uncertainty;delay uncertainty;communication loss;flow dynamics;design principle;performance evaluation;reconfigurable overlay networks","","3","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The software is made from scratch in C++. Input data are two PDB (Protein Data Bank) files and desired docking parameters. The PDB files hold information about protein's atom coordinates in three dimensional space. Protein structures are transformed with spherical functions which allow fast rotation and translation of 3D shapes in space. By translation and rotation (with a given resolution of angles and distance) the surface complementarity is tested for each orientation of two proteins in 3D space. The orientations are then ranked according to the given scores. The output PDB file now holds orientations with best scores ready for visualization. As a part of the system a tool for visualization of molecules was developed. It's purpose is to provide a visualization of molecular structure in all phases of protein docking process. The visualizer also allows interactive translation and rotation of input proteins and evaluation of their complementarity in real time. Although docking tools that use spherical harmonics already exist, we implemented a parallel version using MPI (message passing interface). In this implementation any worker MPI process independently makes docking search on six dimensional subspace determined by parameters in its task. PPDT has high scalability, modularity, variable granularity of tasks and provides significant speedup comparing to a non-parallel version of software.","","978-9-5323-3050-2978-1-4244-7763-0978-953-233-058","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533683","protein docking;spherical harmonics;PDB;MPI","Visualization;Protein engineering;Testing;Shape;Concurrent computing;Message passing;Scalability;Geometry;Electrostatics;Performance analysis","biology computing;C++ language;data visualisation;message passing;proteins","parallel protein docking tool system;shape based process;spherical harmonics;C++;protein data bank files;protein atom coordinates;three dimensional space;protein structures;3D shapes;3D space;PDB file;molecule visualization tool;interactive translation;parallel version;MPI;message passing interface;six dimensional subspace;task variable granularity;nonparallel software version","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To that end, as an example for analysing the performance of a program and for seeing the dependance of the execution time of a program we will study some examples of programs for sorting. Sorting programs are chosen to analyse because many scientist consider sorting as one of the most crucial problems in the study of algorithms and programs. The sorting algorithm are implemented in C++ and tested in 3 machines with different configurations and with different input values, to see the changes of running time depending on many circumstances.

Few algorithms have been designed for this purpose. In this paper a new algorithm based on HSO (hypervolume by slicing objective) is proposed for calculating the exclusive hypervolume contributions of each subset to the whole nondominated set directly for small dimension.

Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplexing (OWDM) is a system that has been proposed as an alternative to OFDM. In this paper we present a novel Sequential Output based Parallel Processing (SBPP) architecture for DAS using OWDM scheme. The experimental evaluation was done on a virtual test bed that includes one central processor with multiple antenna nodes and multiple mobile stations. The novel architecture shows a new approach that could provide a more flexible replacement for OFDM with reduced Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI), while still maintaining the same channel capacity characteristics as OFDM.

So, the heartbeat cycle's impact on the high availability of a dual-controller hot-standby system has become the key of current research. To address the problem of fixed setting heartbeat in building high availability system currently, an adaptive heartbeat fault detection model of dual controller, which can adjust heartbeat cycle based on the frequency of data read-write request, is designed to improve the high availability of dual-controller RAID storage system. Additionally, this heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. Based on this model, the high availability stochastic Petri net model of fault detection was established and used to evaluate the effect of the availability. In addition, we define a AHA (Adaptive Heart Ability) parameter to scale the ability of system heartbeat cycle to adapt to the environment which is changing. The results show that, relatively speaking with fixed configuration, the design is valid and effective, and can enhance dual controller RAID system high availability.","","978-89-88678-26-8978-1-4244-7671","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5572373","component;High availability;Adaptive;Dual controller;Heartbeat","Random access memory;Heating;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Benchmark testing;Meteorology","fault tolerant computing;memory architecture;Petri nets;RAID;software fault tolerance;stochastic processes;system recovery","fault detection;storage system design;data protection technique;data inconsistencies;heartbeat cycle;dual-controller hot-standby system;adaptive heartbeat fault detection model;data read-write request;dual-controller RAID storage system;high availability stochastic Petri net model;adaptive heart ability parameter;AHA parameter","","","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, the non-reliance on stable storage devices simplifies dynamic resize of these platforms, which typically only involves setting up (or shutting down) some data-cache instance. On the other hand, defining the well suited amount of cache servers to be deployed, and the degree of replication of slices of data, in order to optimize reliability/availability and performance tradeoffs, is far from being a trivial task. As a example, scaling up/down the size of the underlying infrastructure might give rise to scarcely predictable secondary effects on the side of the synchronization protocol adopted to guarantee data consistency while supporting transactional accesses. In this paper we investigate on the usage of machine learning approaches with the aim at providing a means for automatically tuning the data grid configuration, which is achieved via dynamic selection of both the well suited amount of cache servers, and the well suited degree of replication of the data-objects. The final target is to determine configurations that are able to guarantee specific throughput or latency values (such as those established by some SLA), under some specific workload profile/intensity, while minimizing at the same time the cost for the cloud infrastructure. Our proposal has been integrated within an operating environment relying on the well known Infinispan data grid, namely a mainstream open source product by the Red Had JBoss division.

Therefore, optimizations that reduce checkpoint overheads are necessary to keep checkpoint/restart mechanisms effective. In this work, we demonstrate that checkpoint data compression is a feasible mechanism for reducing checkpoint commit latencies and storage overheads. Leveraging a simple model for checkpoint compression viability, we show: (1) checkpoint data compression is feasible for many types of scientific applications expected to run on extreme scale systems, (2) checkpoint compression viability scales with checkpoint size, (3) user-level versus system-level checkpoints bears little impact on checkpoint compression viability, and (4) checkpoint compression viability scales with application process count.

In our case, area reduction is achieved by reconfiguring co-processors connected to embedded processors, and flexibility is achieved by permitting new behavior to be easily added to the system. Most of the system is automatically generated by means of MDE techniques. Our modeling approach allows designers to target dynamic reconfiguration without being experts of modern FPGAs.

"Evaluating MPI Implementations Using HPL on an Infiniband Nehalem Linux Cluster","M. Sindi","NA","2010 Seventh International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations","","2010","","","19","25","In conjunction with Moore's Law, computer speeds are expected to double approximately every two years, but with the current challenges that computer manufacturers are facing to double speeds of individual processors, due to various reasons, such as processor temperatures, multiprocessor architectures have become more popular nowadays. Eventually, this has led to an increased interest in standards for writing parallel applications. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) has become the de facto standard for writing parallel applications. Our growing needs for the latest high performance computing solutions in Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producing company, has given us the opportunity to evaluate three of the most commonly used MPI implementations, MVAPICH, Open MPI, and Intel MPI on Intel's latest Nehalem processor. In this paper, we describe our test bed environment along with the evaluations that we did using the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, which is the standard benchmark for ranking the world's Top 500 supercomputers. We also discuss our own developed Web tool that is used to suggest tuned input values for the HPL benchmark. We show the performance numbers in GFLOPS along with the run times and system efficiencies when running on 32, 64 and 128 Infiniband Nehalem Linux cluster nodes using the three implementations of MPI. We finally discuss our results in terms of performance and scalability and we share our interpretations and future work.","","978-1-4244-6271-1978-1-4244-6270-4978-0-7695-3984","10.1109/ITNG.2010.164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501463","Aramco;HPC;Linpack;Linux;MPI","Linux;Computer aided manufacturing;Benchmark testing;Writing;Moore's Law;Manufacturing processes;Temperature;Computer architecture;Application software;Message passing","application program interfaces;Linux;message passing;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures","MPI;message passing interface;HPL;high performance Linpack benchmark;infiniband Nehalem Linux cluster;Moore's law;computer manufacturers;processor temperatures;multiprocessor architectures;high performance computing;MVAPICH;Open MPI;GFLOPS","","1","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A primary cause for this lack of adoption is that neural networks are usually implemented as software running on general-purpose processors. Hence, a hardware implementation that can exploit the inherent parallelism in neural networks is desired. This paper investigates how the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which is a popular type of neural network, can be mapped to a high-performance hardware architecture on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms. The proposed modular framework is designed to reduce the time complexity of the computations through heavily customized hardware engines. A method to partition large RBMs into smaller congruent components is also presented, allowing the distribution of one RBM across multiple FPGA resources. The framework is tested on a platform of four Xilinx Virtex II-Pro XC2VP70 FPGAs running at 100 MHz through a variety of different configurations. The maximum performance was obtained by instantiating an RBM of 256 256 nodes distributed across four FPGAs, which resulted in a computational speed of 3.13 billion connection-updates-per-second and a speedup of 145-fold over an optimized C program running on a 2.8-GHz Intel processor.","1045-9227;1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2073481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580081","Boltzmann machines;computer architecture;field-programmable gate arrays;neural network hardware;parallel processing","Hardware;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Program processors;Equations;Complexity theory;Artificial neural networks","Boltzmann machines;C language;computational complexity;field programmable gate arrays;reconfigurable architectures","high-performance reconfigurable hardware architecture;restricted Boltzmann machines;neural networks;general-purpose processors;field-programmable gate array platforms;time complexity;Xilinx Virtex II-Pro XC2VP70 FPGA;C program;Intel processor","Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Computers;Computers;Neural Networks (Computer);Programming Languages;Software Validation","31","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

So DVFS has a great superiority. Up to now, two DVFS prototypes have been successfully developed, and the structure of decoupled vibratory feeder (DVF) becomes more and more compact.

To create a platform for rapid development and simulation of complex dynamic models, the authors and their colleagues have designed an object-oriented architecture. A portion of the architecture framework is constructed using code generation based on XML component definitions. This paper describes the key aspects of the architecture of the control simulator platform and its code generation capabilities. The simulation platform consists of defining a collection of components represented by differential equations, the capability to select, configure and interconnect components, and the ability to solve the coupled set of equations. The code generation is custom-built, however, the generated code results in more consistency and improved reliability by eliminating error prone steps and allowing the simulation engineer to focus on component mathematical description. As the number of components that are generated increases, the investment in a custom-built code generation is quickly realized by significantly reducing the amount of time required to create or update the code template for each component. The paper also discusses the importance of handling updates as well as the initial creation of code files. The techniques leveraged within this project have been learned through the use of other code generation tools, including GUI development tools. In particular, care has been taken to minimize the accidental loss of manually introduced code and handle version updates of the code generator. Our team is using this framework to develop simulation tests for power plant optimizations and have plans to add custom code generation to other areas of the platform.","","978-1-4244-9877-2978-1-4244-9878","10.1109/LISAT.2011.5784231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5784231","code generation;simulation;model-based engineering","Generators;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;XML;Manuals;Software;Mathematical model","object-oriented methods;program compilers;XML","code generation;simulation platform;object-oriented architecture;XML;differential equations;component mathematical description;GUI development tools;power plant optimizations","","","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48. However, accuracy for this hybrid technique is slightly lower compared to others.","","978-1-4577-2155-7978-1-4577-2154-0978-1-4577-2153","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122808","Intrusion detection system;accuracy;false alarm rate;rough set theory;artificial immune recognition system","Intrusion detection;Accuracy;Training;Testing;Immune system;Data mining","artificial immune systems;computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;rough set theory","rough set theory;artificial immune recognition system;false alarm rate;intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;security threat;software bug;flood attack;DOS attack;IT department;artificial immune system;Rough-AIRS 1;redundant feature;AIS;incremental learning approach;memory storage;NSL-KDD;J48 algorithm;AIRS1 algorithm","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research described in this paper is a continuation of our previous work [1]. In [1], the advantage of the - so called - pessimistic run-time profiling approach was demonstrated and compared to preparation mode profiling and optimistic run-time profiling. Using pessimistic run-time profiling, a 36.09 % reduction in execution time was achieved compared to 23.02% in the optimistic run-time profiling case. These results were obtained using the âHigh Pass Grey-Scale Filterâ benchmark as our case study [2]. Here, we extend the previous results to include a hardware implementation of pessimistic run-time profiling. Due to the parallel execution of run-time profiling and the running algorithm, execution time reduction was increased to 57.73% on the same benchmark. Total energy consumed by our hardware implementation was only 54 Pj, and some 1,371 gates were added to the design. These two figures represent approximately 1.4Ã10<sup>-5</sup>% and 1.828 % increase in energy consumption and gate count, respectively, as compared to the pessimistic-accelerated case and main core gate count. The hardware run-time profiling unit introduced here is based on the ""predetermined basic regions detection"" philosophy, and can operate at a maximum frequency of approximately 278 MHz for this particular case study. Profiling each critical region consumes less than 3.6 ns and executes in parallel with the decode stage of the main processor instruction pipeline. Hardware pessimistic run-time profiling is, thus, able to achieve the same speedup of the full acceleration case - in which no profiling is used - with only a marginal increase in area and energy consumption as compared to the non-accelerated case. All results were obtained using Ten silica [3] and Xilinx [4] Tools.","2325-6532","978-1-4244-9523-8978-0-7695-4314","10.1109/ReConFig.2010.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695299","Reconfigurable;Architecture;Embedded;Processors;Acceleration;Profiling","Acceleration;Hardware;Monitoring;Clocks;Benchmark testing;Power demand;Software","embedded systems;low-power electronics;parallel processing;pipeline processing;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures","self-reconfigurable embedded processor architecture;pessimistic run-time profiling;high pass grey scale filter;parallel execution;execution time reduction;energy consumption;gate count;predetermined basic regions detection;processor instruction pipeline;Tensilica tool;Xilinx tool","","","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing live migration techniques, used to move VMs between hosts, need to involve large data transfer and prevents dynamic consolidation systems from optimizing VM placements efficiently. In this paper, we propose a technique called âmemory reusingâ that reduces the amount of transferred memory of live migration. When a VM migrates to another host, the memory image of the VM is kept in the source host. When the VM migrates back to the original host later, the kept memory image will be âreusedâ, i.e. memory pages which are identical to the kept pages will not be transferred. We implemented a system named MiyakoDori that uses memory reusing in live migrations. Evaluations show that MiyakoDori significantly reduced the amount of transferred memory of live migrations and reduced 87% of unnecessary energy consumption when integrated with our dynamic VM consolidation system.","2159-6190;2159-6182;2159-6182","978-1-4673-2892-0978-0-7695-4755","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253557","virtualization;live migration;IaaS cloud","Servers;Memory management;Benchmark testing;Energy consumption;Compounds;Computer aided software engineering;Educational institutions","cloud computing;computer centres;storage management;virtual machines","MiyakoDori;memory reusing mechanism;dynamic VM consolidation;infrastructure-as-a-service datacenters;virtual machines;resource utilization;live migration techniques;large data transfer;dynamic consolidation systems","","11","25","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The domain is a collection of equilateral triangular 2D regions enriched with explicit adjacency relationships (it is abstract in the sense that no 3D embedding is necessary). It is tailored to minimize isometric distortion, resulting in excellent parameterization qualities, even when meshes with complex shape and topology are mapped into domains composed of a small number of large continuous regions. Moreover, this domain is, in turn, remapped into a collection of 2D square regions, unlocking many advantages found in quad-based domains (e.g., ease of packing). The technique is tested on a variety of cases, including challenging ones, and compares very favorably with known approaches.

To fully utilize the potential of highly parallel machines, tens of thousands of processors are used. Efficiently scaling parallel sorting on machines of this magnitude is inhibited by the communication-intensive problem of migrating large amounts of data between processors. The challenge is to design a highly scalable sorting algorithm that uses minimal communication, maximizes overlap between computation and communication, and uses memory efficiently. This paper presents a scalable extension of the Histogram Sorting method, making fundamental modifications to the original algorithm in order to minimize message contention and exploit overlap. We implement Histogram Sort, Sample Sort, and Radix Sort in Charm++ and compare their performance.

"A Comparative Assessment of Conventional and Machine-Learning-Based Scoring Functions in Predicting Binding Affinities of Protein-Ligand Complexes","H. M. Ashtawy; N. R.

Since a scoring function (SF) is used to score, rank, and identify drug leads, the fidelity with which it predicts the affinity of a ligand candidate for a protein's binding site has a significant bearing on the accuracy of virtual screening. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited predictive power has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with physicochemical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes. We assess the scoring accuracies of these new ML-based SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark dataset on both diverse and protein-family-specific test sets. We find that the best performing ML-based SF has a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.771 between predicted and measured binding affinities compared to 0.644 achieved by a state-of-the-art conventional SF.","","978-1-4577-1799","10.1109/BIBM.2011.128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120516","Machine learning;protein-ligand binding affinity;scoring function;scoring power;structure-based drug design","Proteins;Correlation;Radio frequency;Training;Software;Support vector machines;Drugs","drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;proteins","comparative assessment;machine-learning-based scoring functions;binding affinity prediction;protein-ligand complex;computational biomolecular science;drug discovery;chemical biology;structural biology;virtual screening;force-field based SF;knowledge-based SF;empirical SF;protein-family-specific test sets","","2","11","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is well known that the optical output power is degraded with the heat integration. Hence, thermal management and evaluation system is required. Thermal conductivity is regarded as one of the most important properties that directly influence the thermal performance for thermal interface materials (TIMs). Different methods have been used to measure the thermal conductivity of TIM. Some testers with satisfied accuracy have also been discussed in papers. However, they are generally of high cost and complex structure design. In this paper, a novel thermal conductivity tester for optoelectronic materials with low cost was designed and built based on one-dimension heat transfer theory and the processing technology. Details of the measurement methodology and the apparatus development were introduced. The tester was designed based on ASTM D5470 which is specified to the thermal conductivity measurement of TIM. According to modular design principle, the apparatus can be divided into five parts, including frame, loading, heating and cooling units and in-situ thickness measurement. In determination of the external loads on the test samples, a force transducer was located in the loading module, which would improve the accuracy and repeatability during the tests. A circulating water cooling system and a flexible heating source were utilized to provide temperature gradient. Moreover, an in situ thickness meter was used for the specimen thickness measurement and monitoring, consequently, the error in thickness estimation could be minimized. On the other hand, by using finite element method, the structures of heating and cooling modules were optimized to achieve uniform temperature distribution and the simulated results matched well with the experiment. Thermistors were used for experimental comparison and characterization. A data acquisition system was developed via Labview software for data fitting and result analysis.","","978-1-4244-8142-2978-1-4244-8140-8978-1-4244-8141","10.1109/ICEPT.2010.5582397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582397","thermal interface materials;LED;thermal conductivity;thermal conductivity tester;steady state;ASTM D5470","Thermal conductivity;Heating;Conductivity;Temperature measurement;Thermal resistance;Bars;Materials","finite element analysis;light emitting diodes;thermal conductivity;thermal management (packaging);thermistors","thermal conductivity meter;thermal interface materials;optoelectronic device;light emitting diode;optical output power;heat integration;thermal management;1D heat transfer theory;ASTM D5470;in-situ thickness measurement;force transducer;circulating water cooling system;temperature gradient;thickness estimation;finite element method;thermistors;data acquisition system;Labview software","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the accuracy of automatic handwritten text recognizers improves, post-editing the output of these recognizers could be foreseen as a possible alternative. Alas, the state-of-the-art technology is not suitable to perform this kind of work, since current approaches are not accurate enough and the process is usually both inefficient and uncomfortable for the user. As alternative, an interactive-predictive paradigm has gained recently an increasing popularity, mainly due to promising empirical results that estimate considerable reductions of user effort. In order to assess whether these empirical results can lead indeed to actual benefits, we developed a working prototype and conducted a field study remotely. Thirteen regular computer users tested two different transcription engines through the above-mentioned prototype. We observed that the interactive-predictive version allowed to transcribe better (less errors and fewer iterations to achieve a high-quality output) in comparison to the manual engine. Additionally, participants ranked higher such an interactive-predictive system in a usability questionnaire. We describe the evaluation methodology and discuss our preliminary results.

In order to dynamically adapt such energy requirements to the real device work load, current approaches foster the introduction of low power idle and power scaling primitives in entire devices, internal components and network interfaces. Starting from these considerations, we focus on power scaling, and we propose an analysis of the theoretical and technological limitations in adopting such kind of mechanisms. Thus, our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we performed several tests to identify the technological limitations in a software router based on off-the-shelf hardware, which already includes such capabilities. The results achieved show that the power scaling allows a linear trade-off between consumption and network performance, but the time to switch between two power states may cause a non negligible service interruption. On the other hand, regarding the theoretical limitations, we consider the trade-off between the benefit in dynamically adapting the power states within short time-scales and the overhead needed to choose and select the new power state.","","978-1-4244-8172-9978-1-4244-8173-6978-1-4244-8171","10.1109/ATNAC.2010.5680253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680253","Green Networking;Power Management;Dynamic Power Scaling","Time frequency analysis;Power demand;Optimization;Program processors;Hardware;Multicore processing","network interfaces;performance evaluation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication switching","network devices;routers;switches;production networks;energy saving capability;device work load;low power idle;power scaling primitives;internal components;network interfaces;technological limitations;software router;off-the-shelf hardware;linear trade-off;network performance;non negligible service interruption;theoretical limitations;short time-scales","","3","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The essential part of this method is based on an adaptive network architecture which utilizes both fuzzy model (FIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) into the framework of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). While battery aging proceeds, the system is capable of delivering accurate power prediction for the typical temperature range. Due to design property of ANN, the network parameters are adapted on-line to the current states (state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature). SoC is required as an input parameter to SoAP module and high accuracy is crucial for a reliable self-learning capability. Therefore, a reasonable way to determine the battery state variables is proposed applying a combination of several partly different algorithms. Among others SoC boundary estimation methods, robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) for recalibration of amp hour counters was implemented. ANFIS then achieves the SoAP estimation by means of time forward voltage prognosis (TFVP) before a power pulse. The tradeoff between computational cost of batch-learning and accuracy during on-line adaptation was optimized resulting in a real-time system.

Thus, diagnostic paradigms are needed to correctly detect the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) in the anatomic districts. Furthermore, it would be desirable to have algorithms for the automatic recognition of areas where NPs are localized. In this work an experimental optimization of an algorithm for automatic segmentation of nanoparticle-containing tissues is presented and is based on time-frequency processing of the radiofrequency (RF) signals derived from conventional echographic acquisitions. The employed prototypal software (RULES, Radiofrequency Ultrasonic Local Estimator, developed by ELEN SpA, Florence, Italy) correlates spectral parameters to the mechanical and physical properties of the object examined. The effectiveness of the algorithm was evaluated for different configurations of the spectral parameters and tested for different NP size (330 and 660 nm). Accuracy of the algorithm has been quantified through two parameters: sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, the possibility to improve selective identification of NPs disperse in tissue-mimicking layer was investigated. Through subsequent refinement, the most promising results were obtained with algorithm parameter configuration for 330-nm nanoparticles. In particular, it was found that an increase in sensitivity up to 13.9% (from 63% to 76.9%) is achievable by accepting a decrease of 1.5% in specificity (from 99.6 % to 98.1%).","","978-1-4244-9338-8978-1-4244-9336-4978-1-4244-9337","10.1109/MeMeA.2011.5966745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5966745","Ultrasound;tissue targeting;nanoparticles;automatic segmentation;sensitivity;specifity","Nanoparticles;Sensitivity;Radio frequency;Silicon compounds;Tumors;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging","biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;image segmentation;medical image processing;nanobiotechnology;nanoparticles","automatic segmentation;tissue-targeted nanoparticle;echographic images;cancer targeting agent;ultrasound imaging;time-frequency processing;RULES software;Radiofrequency Ultrasonic Local Estimator software;sensitivity;specificity","","8","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It allows the employment of the same power circuit and control architecture for the islanded operation as those established and optimized for grid-connected power-electronic converter systems. The proposed strategy can be directly adopted for dispatchable systems (e.g., battery energy storage systems) or, alternatively, it can be embedded in a nested control loop for non-dispatchable systems.

The key idea of SAO is to reduce sample distortion by first classifying reconstructed samples into different categories, obtaining an offset for each category, and then adding the offset to each sample of the category. The offset of each category is properly calculated at the encoder and explicitly signaled to the decoder for reducing sample distortion effectively, while the classification of each sample is performed at both the encoder and the decoder for saving side information significantly. To achieve low latency of only one coding tree unit (CTU), a CTU-based syntax design is specified to adapt SAO parameters for each CTU. A CTU-based optimization algorithm can be used to derive SAO parameters of each CTU, and the SAO parameters of the CTU are inter leaved into the slice data.

The source site splits the video content into many small blocks and assigns each block to a single peer for redistribution. Our solution is implemented in a fully meshed P2P network in which peers are connected to each other via UDP links. The video content is encoded using SVC. We present a flow control mechanism that allows us to dynamically optimize the overall throughput and to automatic adjust the video quality for each peer. Thus, peers with different upload capacity receive different video quality. We also combine SVC with MDC to alleviate the packet loss problem.

The change of workload can lead to dynamic service demands on system resources, and even cause dynamic bottleneck switches between services inside the application. In this paper, to profiling large-applications' behaviors, and help to locate the bottleneck and optimize their capacities, we focus on modeling their behavior according to the workload. Although this topic has been well studied at testing stage, building such a model under live workload remains a challenge, because the workload and application behaviors are time-varying. To tackle this problem, we propose an adaptive approach to build and rebuild performance model according to log files. Both the user behaviors and their corresponding internal service relations are modeled, and the CPU time consumed by each service is also obtained through Kalman filter, which can ""absorb"" some level of noise in real-world data. Our model can explain the behaviors of both the whole application and the individual services, and provide valuable information for capacity planning and bottleneck detection. At last, our work is evaluated with TPC-W bench mark, whose results can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","0730-3157;0730-3157;0730-3157","978-0-7695-4439-7978-1-4577-0544-1978-0-7695-4439","10.1109/COMPSAC.2011.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032318","web applications;capacity planning;bottleneck detection;performance modeling;Kalman filter","Servers;Monitoring;Kalman filters;Adaptation models;Capacity planning;Analytical models;Databases","Kalman filters;Web services","adaptive performance modeling approach;performance profiling;multiservice Web application;dynamic service demands;system resources;dynamic bottleneck switches;log files;internal service relation;Kalman filter;capacity planning;bottleneck detection","","1","33","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurately modeling the impact of inter-process cache contention on performance and power consumption is required for optimized process assignment. However, techniques based on exhaustive consideration of process-to-processor mappings and cycle-accurate simulation are inefficient or intractable for CMPs, which often permit a large number of potential assignments. This paper proposes CAMP, a fast and accurate shared cache aware performance model for multi-core processors. CAMP estimates the performance degradation due to cache contention of processes running on CMPs. It uses reuse distance histograms, cache access frequencies, and the relationship between the throughput and cache miss rate of each process to predict its effective cache size when running concurrently and sharing cache with other processes, allowing instruction throughput estimation.We also provide an automated way to obtain process-dependent characteristics, such as reuse distance histograms, without offline simulation, operating system (OS) modification, or additional hardware. We tested the accuracy of CAMP using 55 different combinations of 10 SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks on a dual-core CMP machine. The average throughput prediction error was 1.57%.","","978-1-4244-6024-3978-1-4244-6023","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452065","","Throughput;Histograms;Frequency estimation;Power system modeling;Energy consumption;Multicore processing;Degradation;Predictive models;Operating systems;Hardware","cache storage;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation","cache contention;performance prediction;multi-core systems;chip multiprocessors;last-level cache;reuse distance histograms;cache access frequencies;cache miss rate;operating system modification;CAMP;SPEC CPU2000;cache aware performance model;least-recently-used","","13","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the critical factors in scaling PDES is the efficiency of the underlying global virtual time (GVT) algorithm needed for correctness of parallel execution and speed of progress. Although many GVT algorithms have been proposed previously, few have been proposed for scalable asynchronous execution and none customized to exploit one-sided communication. Moreover, the detailed performance effects of actual GVT algorithm implementations on large platforms are unknown. Here, three major GVT algorithms intended for scalable execution on high-performance systems are studied: (1) a synchronous GVT algorithm that affords ease of implementation, (2) an asynchronous GVT algorithm that is more complex to implement but can relieve blocking latencies, and (3) a variant of the asynchronous GVT algorithm, proposed and studied for the first time here, to exploit one-sided communication in extant supercomputing platforms. Performance results are presented of implementations of these algorithms on up to 129,024 cores of a Cray XT5 system, exercised on a range of parameters: optimistic and conservative synchronization, fine-to medium-grained event computation, synthetic and non-synthetic applications, and different lookahead values. Performance to the tune of tens of billions of events executed per second are registered, exceeding the speeds of any known PDES engine, and showing asynchronous GVT algorithms to outperform state-of-the-art synchronous GVT algorithms. Detailed PDES-specific runtime metrics are presented to further the understanding of tightly-coupled discrete event dynamics on massively parallel platforms.","1094-7256","978-1-4577-1950-9978-1-4577-1951-6978-1-4577-1949","10.1109/HiPC.2011.6152725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152725","Parallel Discrete Event Simulation;Time Warp;Global Virtual Time;One-sided Communication;Asynchrony","Engines;Heuristic algorithms;Portals;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Runtime;Software algorithms","coprocessors;discrete event simulation;parallel machines;parallel programming","parallel discrete event simulation;core processor;PDES;global virtual time;parallel execution;scalable asynchronous execution;synchronous GVT algorithm;asynchronous GVT algorithm;supercomputing;Cray XT5 system;one-sided communication","","1","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we introduce a series of profiling techniques for TM applications that provide in-depth and comprehensive information about the wasted work caused by aborting transactions. We explore three directions: (i) techniques to identify multiple potential conflicts from a single program run, (ii) techniques to identify the data structures involved in conflicts by using a symbolic path through the heap, rather than a machine address, and (iii) visualization techniques to summarize how threads spend their time and which of their transactions conflict most frequently. To examine the effectiveness of the profiling techniques, we provide a series of illustrations from the STAMP TM benchmark suite and from the synthetic WormBench workload. We show how to use our profiling techniques to optimize the performance of the Bayes, Labyrinth and Intruder applications.

For computing grid composed of small local area network(LAN), this problem can be solved by properly building LAN with the use of IPv4 network or high-speed computing network such as Infiniband. However, when the computing resources are distributed in different physical regions, data transmission and communication will be affected by various factors such as time period and load. On the one hand, the stability of transmission cannot be guaranteed; On the other hand, the speed of cross-regional data transmission is not optimistic. As the next generation of Internet protocol, IPv6 is at a transitional stage, and the load is far less than the IPv4-based network. So, it has a better stability and higher bandwidth. With the help of IPv6 network, cross-regional computing grids can be constructed to connect the computing resources in different physical regions in order to deal with some complex computing problems.

The multi-core architecture is introduced to improve computing performance by providing hardware parallelism through more CPU cores, each having restrained clock speed. This has been a break through in High Performance Computing (HPC). While more processor cores rendered effective execution results, multi-core technology inaugurated an extra layer of complexity for programming issues. To exploit each core in a multi-core environment, application software should be optimized by using multithreading. Multi-core processors can even degrade the performance for single threaded application due to reduction in clock speed.

To write data on overlapping tracks may erase data being written previously. Therefore without any data translation layer to redirect updates to different locations to avoid unintended data erasures, the SMR disk cannot be used as a conventional disk to perform unrestricted reads/writes directly. Various data translation/mapping strategies have been proposed to allow the disk to perform unrestricted reads/writes. However these strategies have tradeoffs in terms of system performance and cost, such as disk space utilization. Nevertheless system performance varies for different applications and under different workload conditions. To help optimize the design of a data translation layer for a SMR disk, simulation software is required to analyze tradeoffs and to fine tune parameters for data translation/remapping strategies. We have designed and developed a simulation software for SMR disks. This software can analyze both system performance and disk space utilization. The SMR disk simulation uses the shingled disk profiles generated from the conventional disk profiles which have been experimentally validated. Evaluation studies show that the simulation software can accurately simulate SMR disk performance. This software will be a useful platform to design and test the Shingle Translation Layer (STL) for a SMR disk with different disk layouts and data management strategies, and garbage collection algorithms.","","978-9-8107-2056-8978-1-4673-4734","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407526","Data Band Layout;Data Management;Shingled Recording;Shingled Disk","Magnetic recording;System performance;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Computational modeling","disc drives;disc storage;magnetic recording","shingled magnetic recording disk;shingling;disk drive;data translation layer;unintended data erasures;disk space utilization;data translation strategy;data remapping strategy;SMR disk simulation software;disk profiles;SMR disk performance;shingle translation layer;disk layouts;data management strategy;garbage collection algorithm","","2","7","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"SyncChecker: Detecting Synchronization Errors between MPI Applications and Libraries","Z. Chen; X. Li; J. Chen; H. Zhong; F. Qin","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2012 IEEE 26th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","","2012","","","342","353","While improving the performance, nonblocking communication is prone to synchronization errors between MPI applications and the underlying MPI libraries. Such synchronization error occurs in the following way. After initiating nonblocking communication and performing overlapped computation, the MPI application reuses the message buffer before the MPI library completes the use of the same buffer, which may lead to sending out corrupted message data or reading undefined message data. This paper presents a new method called Sync Checker to detect synchronization errors in MPI nonblocking communication. To examine whether the use of message buffers is well synchronized between the MPI application and the MPI library, Sync Checker first tracks relevant memory accesses in the MPI application and corresponding message send/receive operations in the MPI library. Then it checks whether the correct execution order between the MPI application and the MPI library is enforced by the MPI completion check routines. If not, Sync Checker reports the error with diagnostic information. To reduce runtime overhead, we propose three dynamic optimizations. We have implemented a prototype of Sync Checker on Linux and evaluated it with seven bug cases, i.e., five introduced by the original developers and two injected, in four different MPI applications. Our experiments show that Sync Checker detects all the evaluated synchronization errors and provides helpful diagnostic information. Moreover, our experiments with seven NAS Parallel Benchmarks demonstrate that Sync Checker incurs moderate runtime overhead, 1.3-9.5 times with an average of 5.2 times, making it suitable for software testing.","1530-2075;1530-2075","978-1-4673-0975-2978-0-7695-4675","10.1109/IPDPS.2012.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6267848","","Synchronization;Libraries;Runtime;Instruments;Computer bugs;Semantics;Prototypes","application program interfaces;Linux;message passing;program verification;software libraries","SyncChecker;synchronization errors detection;MPI applications;MPI libraries;message buffer;MPI nonblocking communication;Linux","","5","64","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The convergence of the proposed algorithm is given under some mild conditions, and the validity of the algorithm is proved by the numerical test.","1004-4132","","10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2010.03.027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6073148","Îµ-subgradient;projection algorithm;convex feasibility problem","Projection algorithms;Educational institutions;Systems engineering and theory;Optimization;Program processors;Convergence","","","","","","","","","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

For that purpose, we needed a test platform to evaluate FPGA capabilities to operate as a high performance computer node. We designed an architecture allowing the separation of a parallel program communication from its kernels computation in order to make easier the future partial dynamic reconfiguration of the processing elements. This architecture implements static softcores as test IPs, keeping in mind that the future platform implementing dynamic reconfiguration will allow changing the processing elements.

Once these models have been validated, we use mathematical interpolation to find the parameters of interest. Sometimes, when measurements are not practical or are impossible extrapolation is implemented but with care.

Although powerful in image processing capabilities, CSRNs have high computational demands with increasing input problem size. In this work, we revisit the maze traversal problem to gain an understanding of the general processing of CSRNs. We use a 2.67 GHz Intel Xeon X5550 processor coupled with an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to create several novel accelerated CSRN implementations as a means of overcoming the high computational cost. Additionally, we explore the use of decoupled extended Kalman filters in the CSRN training phase and find a significant reduction in runtime with negligible change in accuracy. We find in our results that we can achieve average speedups of 21.73 and 3.55 times for the training and testing phases respectively when compared to optimized C implementations. The main bottleneck in training performance was a matrix inversion computation. Therefore, we utilize several methods to reduce the effects of the matrix inversion computation.","2161-4407;2161-4393;2161-4393","978-1-4244-9637-2978-1-4244-9635-8978-1-4244-9636","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033575","","Training;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Acceleration;Parallel processing;Runtime;Testing","cellular neural nets;image processing;Kalman filters;matrix inversion;recurrent neural nets","GPGPU acceleration;cellular simultaneous recurrent networks;maze traversals;bioinspired computing;Intel Xeon X5550 processor;NVIDIA Tesla C2050;general purpose graphical processing unit;extended Kalman filters;matrix inversion;image processing;frequency 2.67 GHz","","1","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For several decades, the knowledge and infrastructure has been developed for conventional consumer products, which usually represent the high volume rather than high value electronics market. Therefore, an obvious knowledge gap and lack of supporting hardware and software in testing and qualification of electronics under non-consumer oriented harsh conditions are identified. Unfortunately, the fundamentals of device/components failure mechanisms under combined complex harsh conditions do not exist, which will ultimately underpin the advancement in design and optimization of existing or new products. The goal of this work is on improving the understating of the electronic components' behavior in extreme environments.

Chen","NA; NA","2012 41st International Conference on Parallel Processing","","2012","","","379","388","Many high-end computing applications in critical areas of science and technology are becoming more and more data intensive. These applications transfer large amounts of data from storage nodes to compute nodes for processing, which is costly and bandwidth consuming. The data movement often dominates the applications' run time. Active storage provides a promising solution for these applications by moving appropriate computations from compute nodes to storage nodes. The prior research has achieved considerable progress and developed several active storage models. However, the existing studies have neglected the influence of data dependence on the performance of active storage systems. This study shows that the data dependence has a critical impact on active storage, and the ignorance of dependence can lead to waste of the precious bandwidth. To address this issue in active storage, this paper also presents a new Dynamic Active Storage (DAS) architecture that analyzes the bandwidth requirement of operations, determines the applicability for active storage requests, and optimizes data layout on servers to minimize the bandwidth requirement. Experimental tests have been conducted, and the results have confirmed that the proposed DAS architecture outperforms existing active storage systems. The DAS architecture reduces the data movement caused by data dependence and improves applications' performance over existing schemes.

The follow-up of the plant operation has pointed out the most important items to optimize the safety and operational conditions. The identification of nuclear fuel failures is in this context. The adoption of this operational policy is due to recognition of the detrimental impact that fuel failures have on operating cost, plant availability, and radiation exposure. In this scenario, the defect detection in rods, before fuel reloading, has become an important issue. This paper describes a prototype of an ultrasonic pulse-echo system designed to inspect failed rods (with water inside) from PWR. This system combines development of hardware (ultrasonic transducer, mechanical scanner and pulser-receiver instrumentation) as well as of software (data acquisition control, signal processing and data classification). The ultrasonic system operates at center frequency of 25 MHz and failed rod detection is based on the envelope amplitude decay of successive echoes reverberating inside the clad wall. The echoes are classified by three different methods. Two of them (Linear Fisher Discriminant and Neural Network) have presented 93% of probability to identify failed rods, which is above the current accepted level of 90%. These results suggest that a combination of a reliable data acquisition system with powerful classification methods can improve the overall performance of the ultrasonic method for failed rod detection.","0018-9499;1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2011.2164557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6031787","Neural network;non-destructive testing;nuclear fuel inspection;ultrasound","Fuels;Probes;Acoustics;Electron tubes;Assembly;Inspection;Face","data acquisition;fission reactor fuel;fission reactor operation;fission reactor safety;light water reactors;neural nets;ultrasonic transducers","nuclear fuel inspection;ultrasonic pulse-echo technique;nuclear pressurized water reactor;PWR technology;electric energy generation;operating cost;plant availability;radiation exposure;ultrasonic transducer;mechanical scanner;pulser-receiver instrumentation;data acquisition control;signal processing;data classification;linear Fisher discriminant;neural network;frequency 25 MHz","","","23","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This project presents a software solution, `SearchDroid' that acts as an intermediate user between a search engine and the end user, refining search results based on different topics identified in the search query and their presence and relationships depicted in search results.

The lack of literature combining discourse parsing techniques with web information retrieval has been compensated for by introducing a fresh algorithmic approach. An abstract information retrieval mechanism has been created with the use of discourse parsing techniques, and can be integrated into any web information retrieval approach.

To be competitive in today's market, the IT industry faces many challenges in the development and maintenance of enterprise information systems. Engineering these largescaled systems efficiently requires making decisions about a number of issues. In addition, customers expectations imply continuous software delivery in predictable quality. The operation such systems demands for transparency of the software in regard to lifecycle, change and incident management as well as cost efficiency. Addressing these challenges, we learned how to benefit from traditional industries. Contrary to the fact that the IT business calls itself gladly an industry, the industrialization of software engineering in most cases moves on a rather modest level. Industrialization means not only to build a solution or product on top of managed and well-defined processes, but also to have access to structured information about the current conditions of manufacturing at any time. Comparably with test series and assembly lines of the automobile industry, each individual component and each step from the beginning of manufacturing up to the final product should be equipped with measuring points for quality and progress. Even one step further the product itself, after it has left the factory, should be able to continuously provide analytic data for diagnostic reasons. Information is automatically collected and builds the basic essentials for process control, optimization and continuous improvement of the software engineering process. This presentation shows by means of a practical experience report how AdNovum managed to build its software engineering based on a well-balanced system of processes, continuous measurement and control â as well as a healthy portion of pragmatism.

However, before a smart grid can become fully functional, it requires technological advancements in a number of interdisciplinary domains. Even though smart grid facilitates run-time optimal allocation of power via extensive instrumentation and information accessibility, the process of optimal power allocation becomes challenging due to the massively distributed generation facilities, loads, and due to the intermittency of generation. Optimal power flow problem essentially minimizes the overall cost of power generation while meeting the total load or power demand at the consumer end. In this paper, a Market Based technique has been presented to carry out the optimal power flow in a smart grid. The Market Based Resource Allocation is inspired from the concepts in economic market, where resources are allocated to activities through the process of competitive buying and selling. In the proposed technique, consumers act as potential power buyers and generation units act as the power sellers. The proposed method derives its significance due to its ability in optimizing power flow in a grid in a distributed manner, i.e., from local interactions. This feature provides immense scalability and robustness to uncertainties. In addition, this paper presents the evaluation of the proposed Market Based technique via a simulated scenario of power consumers and producers in a Smart Grid. The IEEE 30-bus system (RTS 79) with six generation units is used to test the proposed method in optimizing the total generation cost, and the results are compared with that obtained from widely used Matpower software.","2378-5861;0743-1619;0743-1619;0743-1619","978-1-4577-1096-4978-1-4577-1095-7978-1-4577-1094-0978-1-4673-2102","10.1109/ACC.2012.6315580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6315580","","Cost function;Load flow;Smart grids;Resource management;Generators;Power generation","power distribution economics;power generation economics;power markets;power utilisation;resource allocation;smart power grids","optimal power flow problem;smart grid;power production;power distribution;power utilization;optimal power allocation;power generation cost minimization;power demand;market based resource allocation;economic market;IEEE 30-bus system;RTS 79;Matpower software","","4","28","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming to reduce the hardware design and implementation costs with respect to custom hardware solutions, the OpenMAC platform has been implemented on an inexpensive off-the-shelf reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based development board with a processor embedded in the FPGA. The challenge presented by the proposed platform is to fulfil strict MAC time-constraints with compiled straightforward and clean C++ code. For this purpose, the OpenMAC platform introduces an innovative hardware/software partitioning concept for MAC protocol implementation which is based on a shared-memory architecture.

However, it is often a time- and computing-intensive task, and would be well served by more expeditious modeling methods than full Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) thermofluidic models. A software package named COMPACT (Compact Model of Potential Flow and Convective Transport) was developed to provide one such alternative. Recent versions of COMPACT take under 10 seconds on a commercially available laptop to characterize a 550 square foot data center; the same room modeled with a CFD solver took 8 hours. Having the ability to create velocity and temperature predictions orders of magnitude faster than conventional CFD allow a variety of data center applications for the model, such as use as a first-order design tool, a potential improvement to plant-based controllers, a tool for system-wide assessment of life-cycle efficiency, and as an initial guess for complex CFD solvers. COMPACT applies convective energy transport equations to a computed potential flow field to approximate a flow and temperature field. The results from this model were compared to experimental measurements taken from a data center at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, CA. The presence of high localized temperatures in the model led to the conclusion that recirculation and buoyancy were contributing excessively to error in the model. A novel approach was proposed to account for these effects: a non-iterative (to preserve computational resources) method of vortex superposition, in which hot locations in the original model are analyzed and a corrective flow field consisting of Rankine vortices is superimposed on the solution. An updated model using this approach was tested with further experimental measurements taken from the data center at HP Labs, and identical inputs were used to compare COMPACT to commercially available CFD. These newer results showed a marked decrease in mean deviation of the model from measured temperatures, as well as elimination of the highly localized temperatures which afflicted the original COMPACT results. The vortex superposition model was also âtunedâ, with vortex strength optimized for multiple test cases at varying levels of recirculation. In addition, the model-generated velocity and temperature fields were used to locate and quantify the destruction of exergy resulting from the mixing of warmer and cooler air in the room; these results are used as a measure of system efficiency.","1087-9870;1087-9870","978-1-4244-9532-0978-1-4244-9533-7978-1-4244-9531","10.1109/ITHERM.2012.6231413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231413","compact;expeditious;modeling;CFD;thermal performance;server room;convective transport;vortex superposition;life cycle exergy assessment;exergy destruction","Temperature measurement;Servers;Computational modeling;Computational fluid dynamics;Mathematical model;Atmospheric modeling;Data models","computer centres;convection;mechanical engineering computing;remaining life assessment;vortices","vortex model evaluation;buoyancy-driven recirculation;potential flow analysis;data center performance;flow prediction;computational fluid dynamic;CFD thermofluidic models;compact model of potential flow and convective transport;COMPACT software package;temperature predictions;first-order design tool;plant-based controllers;life-cycle efficiency assessment;system-wide assessment;convective energy transport equations;Hewlett-Packard laboratory;Rankine vortices;vortex superposition model;vortex strength;model-generated velocity;time 10 s;time 8 hour","","3","13","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Weight reduction can be achieved primarily by the introduction of better material, design optimization and better manufacturing processes. The achievement of weight reduction with adequate improvement of mechanical properties has made composite a very good replacement material for conventional steel. Selection of material is based on cost and strength of material. The composite materials have more elastic strain energy storage capacity and high strength to weight ratio as compared with those of steel, so multi-leaf steel springs are being replaced by mono-leaf composite springs. The paper gives the brief look on the suitability of composite leaf spring on vehicles and their advantages. The objective of the present work is design, analysis and fabrication of mono composite leaf spring. The design constraints are stress and deflections. The material selected is glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) and the epoxy resin can be used which is more economical to reduce total cost of composite leaf spring with similar mechanical and geometrical properties to the multileaf spring. The composite leaf spring is fabricated by hand lay-up technique and tested.

One aspect of the current work includes the development of taking timed tagged event-byevent data using our custom designed software with the Canberra Lynx Digital Signal Analyzer to provide a unique three-dimensional master data set with channel/energy, time, and intensity information. Since the master data set is not limited to predetermined coincidence timing gates set for a specific nuclear process, the user is allowed the flexibility to slice the data cube in a multitude of ways without loss of information or experimental time due to the need for additional acquisition windows. Time tagged event-by-event data allows the user to isolate a particular energy line from the spectrum over a specific window in time with respect to the PNG pulse, analyze a gamma ray spectrum resulting from either neutron capture, between the burst, or inelastic scattering events, during the neutron burst, and extract data for engineering purposes to optimize timing windows to look at specific elements in different environments.

The aim of image compression is to reduce redundant information in image data. However, most image compression algorithms have problems such as computational complexity, computational load and so on. Parallel computing is an effective means to improve the processing speed. With the development of high-performance parallel processing systems, parallel image processing algorithms provides more space for improving image processing speed. And with the improvement of GPU performance, GPU is increasingly applied in the computing-concentrated data operation. According to the parallelism and programmability of CUDA, the acceleration for JPEG compression is addressed in this paper. CUDA makes it possible for GPU to do the general purpose computing. The powerful parallel computing power of CUDA GPU can improve the processing speed of JPEG image compression easily. For the parallel processing features and programmability of CUDA, this paper introduces a method of accelerating image compression based on CUDA. An optimal algorithm is proposed as well. The introduction of CUDA allows the image compression for nearly 20 to 24 times speedup. In the end of the paper, we optimize and test the program, and make the analysis of experimental results. Finally we summarize some hardware and software features of CUDA, and propose a basic method of optimizing CUDA kernels from the analysis of the experiment.","","978-1-4673-0024-7978-1-4673-0025-4978-1-4673-0023","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234221","JPEG image compression;CUDA;GPU;DCT;parallel computing","Graphics processing unit;Discrete cosine transforms;Instruction sets;Image coding;Parallel processing;Transform coding;Quantization","data compression;design engineering;graphics processing units;image coding;parallel architectures;parallel programming","parallel program design;JPEG compression encoding;image compression;data compression technology;redundant information reduction;computational complexity;computational load;parallel computing;high-performance parallel processing systems;parallel image processing algorithms;GPU performance;computing-concentrated data operation;general purpose computing;CUDA kernel optimization","","3","10","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modeling of constraints is an important issue in power system scheduling. These constraints are therefore ""fuzzy"" in nature, and crisp treatment of them may lead to over conservative solutions. In this paper, a fuzzy optimization-based method is developed to solve power system GS problem using fuzzy membership functions (MFs) for objective and some constraints. This fuzzy GS problem is firstly converted to a crisp formulation and then is solved using GAMS software based on mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). This problem is applied to a test system which has pumped storage power plants to modify the uncertainties of wind power output and other parameters in power system. The results of this problem are compared with the results of crisp solution results and in different aspiration values of the total profit. Numerical testing results show that near optimal schedules are obtained, and the method can provide a good balance between increasing profit and satisfying constraints.","2157-4847;2157-4839;2157-4839","978-1-4244-6255-1978-1-4244-6253-7978-1-4244-6254","10.1109/APPEEC.2011.5748596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5748596","","Wind power generation;Wind farms;Wind forecasting;Maintenance engineering;Reservoirs;Power systems;Optimal scheduling","fuzzy set theory;integer programming;nonlinear programming;power generation scheduling;pumped-storage power stations;wind power plants","generation scheduling;wind farms;load-generation balance;wind power generation constraints;power system scheduling;fuzzy optimization-based method;fuzzy membership functions;mixed integer nonlinear programming;pumped storage power plants","","","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research presents the development of a novel hazard assessment strategy, combining high-resolution remote sensing with a numerical modeling approach. The research was implemented at a railway test site located in northern England, U.K.; ALS data and multispectral aerial imagery facilitated the determination of key slope stability variables, which were then used to parameterize a coupled hydrological-geotechnical model, in order to simulate slope behavior under current and future climates. A software toolset was developed to integrate the core elements of the methodology and determine resultant slope failure hazard which could then be mapped and queried within a geographical information system environment. Results indicate that the earthworks are largely stable, which is in broad agreement with the management company's slope hazard grading data, and in terms of morphological analysis, the remote methodology was able to correctly identify 99% of earthworks classed as embankments and 100% of cuttings. The developed approach provides an effective and practicable method for remotely quantifying slope failure hazard at fine spatial scales (0.5 m) and for prioritizing and reducing on-site inspection.","0196-2892;1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2165547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032742","Airborne laser scanning (ALS);hazard mapping;railway engineering;remote sensing","Hazards;Meteorology;Remote sensing;Stability analysis;Rail transportation;Numerical stability;Vegetation mapping","geographic information systems;geomorphology;geophysical techniques;geotechnical engineering;hazardous areas;numerical analysis;railways;remote sensing;roads","remote sensing approach;landslide hazard assessment;engineered slopes;earthworks;embankments;cuttings;road networks;rail networks;airborne laser scanning;numerical modeling approach;northern England;U.K;ALS data;multispectral aerial imagery;coupled hydrological-geotechnical model;slope behavior;software toolset;slope failure hazard;geographical information system;morphological analysis","","11","38","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the unacceptably high cost of ITS equipment failures, preventative maintenance and dense operational testing are high priorities. In this paper we present a low-cost distributed instrumentation system (DIS) for continuous monitoring of critical ITS components. Over the last three years, we have developed and deployed the DIS in the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) private fiberoptic network that spans several major metropolitan areas in and around Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Lawton. The Oklahoma DIS is responsible for monitoring the health of the entire ODOT ITS communications network as well as the integrity of each camera video signal and the operational status of each DMS. All of the information acquired by the DIS is integrated into an operational summary that is available on a private website for the design and execution of ITS equipment maintenance plans. In Oklahoma, information acquired by the DIS has been successfully integrated into a wide range of operation and maintenance (O&M) planning, which has led to a significant improvement in terms of overall ITS quality of service (QoS) and a quantifiable reduction in wasted costs associated with the premature discarding of energy storage devices.","2153-0017;2153-0009;2153-0009","978-1-4577-2197-7978-1-4577-2198-4978-1-4577-2196","10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6082868","","Instruments;Monitoring;Maintenance engineering;Batteries;Temperature sensors;Software;Resource management","automated highways;computer network management;computerised monitoring;maintenance engineering;optical fibre networks;telecommunication equipment;telecommunication network planning","low cost distributed instrumentation system;irregular pattern monitoring;irregular pattern identification;irregular pattern diagnostics;critical ITS components;ITS telecommunication infrastructure;information gathering equipment;information distribution equipment;emergency situation;Oklahoma Department of Transportation;private fiber optic network;metropolitan area;operation planning;maintenance planning;ITS quality of service;QoS;intelligent transportation system","","","16","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then demonstrate its performance by applying it to the design of a Prognosis and Health Monitoring (PHM) system for an ocean current power generator. Three common methodologies for system hazard analysis were tested by applying them to the PHM system's network topology architecture; STAMP-based Process Analysis (STPA), Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP), and a Resilience Engineering, Heuristic-based approach. While all three approaches adequately revealed most PHM system hazards, which assisted in identifying the means with which to mitigate them, none of the approaches fully addressed the multi-state dimensionality of the sub-components of the system, missing risky and hazardous scenarios. We developed the System Hazard Indication and Extraction Learning Diagnosis (SHIELD) methodology for system hazard analysis and resilient design. SHIELD integrates state space analysis into the hazard analysis process in order to facilitate the location of undiscovered hazard scenarios. Our approach uses recursive, top-down system decomposition with subsystem, interface, and process cycle identification. Then, a bottom-up recursive evaluation is completed where we analyze the subsystem state space and state transitions with regard to hazards/failures in process cycles. This yields a comprehensive list of failure states and scenarios. Finally, a top-down prioritized application of resilient engineering heuristics which address hazard scenarios is prescribed. This final phase results in a comprehensive, complete analysis of complex system architectures forcing resilience into the final system design.","","978-1-4673-0750-5978-1-4673-0748-2978-1-4673-0749","10.1109/SysCon.2012.6189490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189490","risk analysis;hazard analysis;system resilience engineering","Hazards;Prognostics and health management;Resilience;Software;Turbines;Monitoring","computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;hazards;hydroelectric power stations;ocean waves;wave power generation","resilient system design;complex system design;system resilience engineering;ocean current power generator;PHM;system network topology architecture;STAMP-based process analysis;hazard and operability analysis;HAZOP;heuristic-based approach;system hazard indication and extraction learning diagnosis;system hazard analysis;SHIELD;state space analysis;top-down system;process cycle identification;bottom-up recursive evaluation;state transition;prognosis and health monitoring","","2","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the process of extracting features is severely affected by a large amount of noisy logs. While the existing work tries to solve the problem by compressing logs in temporal and spatial views or removing the semantic redundancy between logs, they fail to consider the co-existence of other noisy faults that generate error logs instead of injected faults, for example, random hardware faults, unexpected bugs of softwares, system configuration faults or the error rank of a log severity. During a fault feature extraction process, those noisy faults generate error logs that are not related to a target fault, and will strongly mislead the resulted fault features. We call an error log that is not related to a target fault a noisy error log. To filter out noisy error logs, we present a similarity-based error log filtering method SBF, which consists of three integrated steps: (1) model error logs into time series and use haar wavelet transform to get the approximate time series; (2) divide the approximate time series into sub time series by valleys; (3) identify noisy error logs by comparing the similarity between the sub time series of target error logs and the template of noisy error logs. We apply our log filtering method in an enterprise cloud system and show its effectiveness. Compared with the existing work, we successfully filter out noisy error logs and increase the precision and the recall rate of fault feature extraction.","2325-6648;2325-6664","978-1-4577-0375-1978-1-4577-0374-4978-1-4577-0373","10.1109/DSNW.2011.5958800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958800","error log;event filtering;fault injection;large scale distributed system","Time series analysis;Noise measurement;Feature extraction;Wavelet transforms;Computer crashes;Complexity theory;Approximation methods","cloud computing;data compression;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;feature extraction;system monitoring;time series;wavelet transforms","fault identification;noisy error log filtering;fault injection tests;large scale distributed systems;data compression;semantic redundancy;fault feature extraction;time series;wavelet transform;enterprise cloud system","","4","20","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regardless of the matcher, the general poor performance is a confirmation of previous findings related to latent vs tenprint matching.

As a result, performance of the target software can be significantly increased just by tuning to the hardware and processing data being used.

Yet, the increasing data complexity challenges most, if not all, of the existing data compression methods. In fact, lossless compression techniques offer no more than 10% reduction on scientific data that we have experience with, which is widely regarded as effectively incompressible. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we advocate a transformative strategy that enables fast, accurate, and multi-fold reduction of double-precision floating-point scientific data. The intuition behind our method is inspired by an effective use of preconditioners for linear algebra solvers optimized for a particular class of computational ""dwarfs"" (e.g., dense or sparse matrices). Focusing on a commonly used multi-resolution wavelet compression technique as the underlying ""solver"" for data reduction we propose the S-preconditioner, which transforms scientific data into a form with high global regularity to ensure a significant decrease in the number of wavelet coefficients stored for a segment of data. Combined with the subsequent EQ-calibrator, our resultant method (called S-Preconditioned EQ-Calibrated Wavelets (SPEQC-Wavelets)), robustly achieved a 4- to 5-fold data reduction-while guaranteeing user-defined accuracy of reconstructed data to be within 1% point-by-point relative error, lower than 0.01 Normalized RMSE, and higher than 0.99 Pearson Correlation. In this paper, we show the results we obtained by testing our method on six petascale simulation codes including fusion, combustion, climate, astrophysics, and subsurface groundwater in addition to 13 publicly available scientific datasets. We also demonstrate that application-driven data mining tasks performed on decompressed variables or their derived quantities produce results of comparable quality with the ones for the original data.","2374-8486;1550-4786;1550-4786","978-1-4577-2075-8978-0-7695-4408","10.1109/ICDM.2011.138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137233","preconditioners for data mining;data reduction;data mining over decompressed data;in situ data analytics;extreme-scale data analytics","Data models;Vectors;Wavelet transforms;Accuracy;Indexes;Correlation;Sparse matrices","data analysis;data mining;data reduction;mean square error methods;wavelet transforms","S-preconditioner;multifold data reduction;user-controlled accuracy;petascale scientific simulation codes;system hardware capability;system software capability;data analysis;data complexity;lossless data compression techniques;transformative strategy;double-precision floating-point scientific data;linear algebra solvers;multiresolution wavelet compression technique;wavelet coefficients;data reconstruction;Pearson correlation;application driven data mining","","","26","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, accessing this potential depends substantially on the availability of sophisticated control systems. Delft University of Technology is developing a kite power generator which operates a tethered inflatable membrane wing in a pumping cycle. The flight trajectory is controlled by an actuator unit suspended below the wing and communicates with the ground station control centre via a fast and reliable wireless link. The link is also used to transmit the data of the on-board sensors to the ground. In a future wind park of many kite power systems, the individual kites and ground stations have to communicate among each other, to avoid collisions and to optimize the total energy output of the park. A preparatory analysis has shown that the current prototype would significantly benefit from a distributed control system approach, achieving higher efficiency and increased operational flexibility.

"Hidden Markov Model for eye gaze prediction in networked video streaming","Yunlong Feng; Gene Cheung; Wai-tian Tan; Yusheng Ji","The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Japan; National Institute of Informatics, Japan; Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, USA; National Institute of Informatics, Japan","2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","","2011","","","1","6","With the advent of eye gaze tracking technology, eye gaze is increasingly being used as a media interaction trigger in a variety of applications, such as eye typing, video content customization, and network video streaming based on region-of-interest (ROI). The reaction time of a gaze-based networked system, however, is in practice lower-bounded by the round trip time (RTT) of today's networks, which can be large. To improve the efficacy of gaze-based networked systems, in the paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based gaze prediction strategy to predict future gaze locations to lower end-to-end reaction delay. We first design an HMM with three states corresponding to human's three major types of intrinsic eye movements. HMM parameters are obtained offline on a per-video basis during training phase. During testing phase, a window of noisy gaze observations are collected in real-time as input to a forward algorithm, which computes the most likely HMM state. Given the deduced HMM state, linear prediction is used to predict gaze location RTT seconds into the future. We demonstrate the applicability of our gaze prediction strategy by focusing on ROI-based bit allocation for network video streaming. To reduce transmission rate of a video stream without degrading viewer's perceived visual quality, we allocate more bits to encode the viewer's current spatial ROI, while devoting fewer bits in other spatial regions. The challenge lies in overcoming the delay between the time a viewer's ROI is detected by gaze tracking, to the time the effected video is encoded, delivered and displayed at the viewer's terminal. To this end, we use our proposed gaze-prediction strategy to predict future eye gaze locations, so that optimized bit allocation can be performed for future frames. Our experiments show that bit rate can be reduced by 21% without noticeable visual quality degradation when end-to-end network delay is as high as 200ms.","1945-788X;1945-7871;1945-7871","978-1-61284-350-6978-1-61284-348-3978-1-61284-349","10.1109/ICME.2011.6011935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6011935","Eye-gaze prediction;network streaming","Hidden Markov models;Indexes;Predictive models;Training;Software","","","","6","17","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Robotic grasping has made significant progress, but still has not reached the level of robustness or versatility shown by human grasping. It would be useful to understand what parameters (called grasp measures) humans optimize as they grasp objects, how these grasp measures are varied for different tasks, and whether they can be applied to physical robots to improve their robustness and versatility. This paper demonstrates a new way to gather human-guided grasp measures from a human interacting haptically with a robotic arm and hand. The results revealed that a human-guided strategy provided grasps with higher robustness on a physical robot even under a vigorous shaking test (91%) when compared with a state-of-the-art automated grasp synthesis algorithm (77%). Furthermore, orthogonality of wrist orientation was identified as a key human-guided grasp measure, and using it along with an automated grasp synthesis algorithm improved the automated algorithm's results dramatically (77% to 93%).","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1978-1-4244-5040","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509855","","Anthropometry;Robustness;Robotics and automation;Humans;Grasping;Service robots;Grippers;Wrist;Robotic assembly;Open source software","robot kinematics","robotic grasp;human-guided grasp;robotic arm;robotic hand;automated grasp synthesis algorithm","","34","32","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The situation of imperfect competition arising when one of the Gencos is large enough to exert market power is considered in detail, showing what bidding behaviors are to be expected when such a market arrangement occurs. The impact that inter-area transmission system congestions may have on the mechanism of system pricing is also addressed. The bidding problem faced by each Genco is formulated as a strategic multi-player game in which the choice between different bidding levels and energy amounts to be sold at the market has to be made. The large size of the problem due to the number of competitors and to the presence of transmission constraints makes the application of classical game theory troublesome. Therefore, an agent based method belonging to the category of coevolutionary genetic algorithm was selected for the solution of this problem. Test cases illustrate the different strategies that the Gencos may implement to optimize their performance at the day-ahead market.

Firstly, Abaqus code, one of the Finite Element Method (FEM) software, was utilized to calculate 100 J-integral values of crack tip by defining directly. Secondly, the 100 J-integral values of crack tip were used as training data and testing data by Optimized Least Squares Support Vector Machine (OLS-SVM), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to get other 20000 J-integral values of crack tip.

In this paper, a combination of techniques are carefully selected, tailored, and organized to improve the image quality for automatic segmentation of the articular cartilage from noisy MR images. A prototype software procedure is developed based on that. First, the Rician noise, known as the major factor contributing to corrupt the magnitude MR images, is investigated. A method based on the least squares approach is employed to estimate the noise standard deviation from the background mode of the image. Then, a total variation noise removal algorithm using iterative scheme is applied to remove the noise. After that, the vector field convolution active contour method is applied to the resultant image for cartilage segmentation. Two different approaches are proposed to define the initial contour to avoid local optimization traps. A test set MR images on 62 slices of human knee is used to illustrate the proposed system.

Because of the high current and strong magnetic field, the Lorentz force in the protection inductor is large. This paper describes the calculation of the inductance and the optimization of the stresses in the protection inductor. A finite element analysis with the ANSYS software is used to calculate the magnetic field and stresses in the protection inductor. A three-dimensional static finite element analysis model of the inductor has been built for calculating the stresses in the copper coils and stainless steel rings as well as the static inductance. Furthermore, a harmonic finite element analysis model has been built to analyse effects such as the influence of eddy currents in the copper wires and induced current in the stainless steel rings on stress and inductance. Eddy currents cause an uneven distribution of stresses; induced current can decrease the stresses in the copper coils but increase those in the stainless steel rings. Both effects reduce the inductance. The typical maximum stresses in our design are 70 MPa in the copper coils and 210 MPa in the stainless steel rings; these are both below the yield strength of these materials. The inductance is 1.05 mH at the frequency of 50 Hz.

The safety-function of the software part of protection relays is first to detect any faults within the supervised power network, then ask the tripping of the circuit breakers in order to isolate the faulty portion of the network. However, it is required that detection and isolation of faults must occur within a given time, as specified by the IEC 60255 standard. Schneider Electric currently achieves the demonstration that a protection relay is performing its safety-function within such temporal constraints at the price of a costly phase of tests. The OASIS approach is a complete tool-chain to build safety-critical deterministic real-time systems, which enables the demonstration of the system timeliness. In this paper, we show how we apply the OASIS approach to build a deterministic protection relay system. We designed a software platform called OASISepam, based on an existing product from Schneider Electric, namely the Sepam 10. We show a preliminary evaluation of our implementation over a STR710 ARM-based board that runs the OASIS kernel. Notably, we show that the observed worst-case end-to-end detection time of OASISepam fulfils the specified constraint expressed in the design phase and translated in the OASIS programming model. Consequently, the temporal behaviour of protection relays is mastered, thus reducing application development costs and allowing the optimization of selectivity.","2150-3109;2150-3117","978-1-4244-5841-7978-1-4244-5839-4978-1-4244-5840","10.1109/SIES.2010.5551378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551378","Power network protection relay;real-time operating system;deterministic multi-scale time-triggered system;spatial and temporal partitioning;end-to-end temporal constraint","Relays;Real time systems;Circuit faults;Kernel;Hardware;Delay","circuit breakers;IEC standards;power engineering computing;power system protection;real-time systems;relay protection","safety-oriented real-time OASIS;deterministic protection relays;medium voltage protection relays;safety integrated level;IEC 61508 standard;circuit breakers;IEC 60255 standard;Schneider Electric;OASISepam;Sepam 10;STR710 ARM","","5","14","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designers of such systems are normally expected to optimize the system performance and/or introduce new functionalities by evolving the existing system architecture. Our aim of this paper was to optimize system performance of a SOA-based control system by evolving the architecture of the particular service component within the system, which is responsible for complex calculations on large-scale graph models, under near to real time restrictions. This service component transforms system models into task trees, which are then executed by the runtime library that is referred to as the Task Tree Executor (TTE). The goal of this paper was to introduce finer grained parallelism, thus better multicore CPU utilization, by evolving TTE architecture in such a way that novel architecture executes TTE tasks as Intel TBB tasks rather than Win32/Linux threads, which was the case for the previous TTE architecture. The experimental evaluation based on measuring time needed for TTE reliability estimation, by statistical usage tests, shows that novel TTE architecture provides the speedup of around 8 times, on average, over the previous one. Although the focus of the paper is on a particular component, of a particular system, the approach that we took should be applicable on a broader class of SOA-based systems.","","978-1-4673-0912-7978-0-7695-4664","10.1109/ECBS.2012.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195188","service oriented architecture;architecture evolution;task trees;parallel programming;threading building blocks","Computer architecture;Parallel processing;Games;Libraries;Architecture;Service oriented architecture;Instruction sets","","","","","19","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the detection method is based on the novel concept of Low Transient Pulse (LTP), the overall system implementation utilizes two microelectronics technologies: Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The DSP carries out the analysis of the received signal at a much lower rate hence can accommodate a large number of signal channels. The FPGA runs at a higher frequency (62.5MHz) to generate the LTP signal and to calculate the envelope of the received signal (sampled at 1MHz). This research elaborates on designing a Quadrature AM (QAM) demodulator on the FPGA for the received signal from the ultrasound and for the detection of the presence of edges/fracture on the test materials.

Our sensor network is based on the low-power and low-data rate standard IEEE 802.15.4, and we used inexpensive hardware. Nevertheless, the system meets requirements imposed by Structural Health Monitoring applications thanks to an efficient use of hardware resources and adopting a novel communication protocol which optimize bandwidth utilization. In addition, we developed a complete software architecture to integrate the Wireless Sensor Network with an existing measurement system. Our prototype WSN was tested through shaking tests in a controlled environment to validate the approach, and to identify problems which should be addressed before using the system on real-world buildings.

AMS establishes multiple connections from a STA to neighbor STAs and determines proper routing path effectively, where three objectives are optimized, i.e., minimizing the average hop count, balancing traffic load and without modifying the communicating procedure in IEEE 802.11 standard. AMS owns self-organization capacity, establishes multiple connections and determines routing path automatically. Our AMS only uses simple software functions without the cost of extra hardware overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system performance. Importantly, AMS that works very well has been implemented and exhaustively tested in a realistic test-bed.","2376-6492;2376-6506","978-1-4244-9538-2978-1-4244-9539-9978-1-4244-9537","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982505","wireless mesh networks;IEEE 802.11;layer 2","Logic gates;Wireless communication","Internet;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks","automatic mesh scheme;IEEE 802.11;wireless mesh networks;wireless Internet access;routing path;average hop count;balancing traffic load;self-organization capacity;hardware overhead","","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"PYNPOINT: An image processing package for finding exoplanets","A. Amara; S. P. Quanz","NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","","2012","427","2","948","955","We present the scientific performance results of PYNPOINT, our Python-based software package that uses principal component analysis to detect and estimate the flux of exoplanets in two-dimensional imaging data. Recent advances in adaptive optics and imaging technology at visible and infrared wavelengths have opened the door to direct detections of planetary companions to nearby stars, but image processing techniques have yet to be optimized. We show that the performance of our approach gives a marked improvement over what is presently possible using existing methods such as LOCI. To test our approach, we use real angular differential imaging (ADI) data taken with the adaptive optics-assisted high resolution near-infrared camera NACO at the VLT. These data were taken during the commissioning of the apodizing phase plate (APP) coronagraph. By inserting simulated planets into these data, we test the performance of our method as a function of planet brightness for different positions on the image. We find that in all cases PYNPOINT has a detection threshold that is superior to that given by our LOCI analysis when assessed in a common statistical framework. We obtain our best improvements for smaller inner working angles (IWAs). For an IWA of â¼0.29 arcsec we find that we achieve a detection sensitivity that is a factor of 5 better than LOCI. We also investigate our ability to correctly measure the flux of planets. Again, we find improvements over LOCI, with PYNPOINT giving more stable results. Finally, we apply our package to a non-APP data set of the exoplanet Î² Pictoris b and reveal the planet with high signal-to-noise. This confirms that PYNPOINT can potentially be applied with high fidelity to a wide range of high-contrast imaging data sets.","0035-8711;1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21918.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183347","methods: data analysis;techniques: image processing;planets and satellites: detection","","","","","1","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals & Magazines"

Examples are drawn primarily from NEPTUNE Canada (NC), which completed installation of the subsea infrastructure and 60 diverse instruments in 2009, with 40 more in 2010, thereby establishing the world's first regional cabled ocean observatory, northeast Pacific Ocean, off British Columbia's coast. Initial data flow started in December 2009. Another 30 instruments will be deployed in 2011-12. Introducing abundant power and high bandwidth communications into a range of ocean environments allows discrimination between short and long-term events, interactive experiments, real time data and imagery, and complex multidisciplinary teams interrogating a vast database over the observatory's 25-year design life. Scientific priorities and observatory node sites were identified through workshops. Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks designed, manufactured and installed the 800km backbone cable and five nodes (stepping 10kV DC to 400V DC). Node sites are located at the coast (Folger Passage), continental slope (ODP 889; Barkley Canyon), abyssal plain (ODP 1027), and ocean-spreading ridge (Endeavour), in water depths of 100-2660m. Principal scientific themes are: plate tectonic processes and earthquake dynamics; dynamic processes of seabed fluid fluxes and gas hydrates; regional ocean/climate dynamics and effects on marine biota; deep-sea ecosystem dynamics; and engineering and computational research. The Data Management and Archive System (DMAS) provides controls for the observatory network and transparent access to other data providers using interoperability techniques within a Web 2.0 environment. Users can perform data visualization and analysis on-line with either default or custom processing code, as well as simultaneously interacting with each other. Oceans 2.0 is adding tools to perform software-aided feature detection and classification of sounds in acoustic data streams. New knowledge and scientific interpretations are addressing important science applications of the observatory: ocean/climate change, ocean acidification, recognizing and mitigating natural hazards, non-renewable and renewable natural resources. Challenges are considerable: technical innovations, enlarging the user base, management, funding, maximizing educational/outreach activities. Socio-economic benefits are substantial: not only the transformation of ocean sciences but with many applications in sectors such as sovereignty, security, transportation, data services, and public policy. Opportunities for commercialization of technologies and data services/products are being facilitated by the Centre of Enterprise and Engagement (www.onccee.ca) within Ocean Networks Canada (www.networkscanada.ca) that manages the NC and VENUS observatories (www.neptunecanada.ca; www.uvic.venus.ca). Cabled ocean observatories are transforming the ocean sciences and will result in a progressive wiring of the oceans. They are designed to be expandable in footprint, nodes and instruments, and the range of scientific questions, and to provide facilities for testing technology prototypes. They will provide a wealth of new research opportunities and socio-economic benefits.","","978-1-4577-0164-1978-1-4577-0165-8978-1-4577-0163","10.1109/UT.2011.5774134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5774134","","Oceans;Observatories;Instruments;Real time systems;Venus;Optical fiber cables;Monitoring","geophysics computing;open systems;submarine cables","cabled ocean observatories;NEPTUNE Canada;ocean science;subsea infrastructure;high bandwidth communications;backbone cable;continental slope;abyssal plain;ocean-spreading ridge;plate tectonic processes;earthquake dynamics;seabed fluid fluxes;gas hydrates;regional ocean dynamics;climate dynamics;data management and archive system;interoperability;Web 2.0;Oceans 2.0;size 800 km;depth 100 m to 2660 m","","1","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, considering the large amount of sampled data, limited power supply and wireless bandwidth of WSNs, it is generally not possible for sensor nodes to monitor structural condition continuously especially for long-term SHM. From SHM perspective, it is highly desirable to collect data during the occurrence of some certain kinds of events such as earthquakes, large wind, etc, since data collected during these periods are more informative for damage detection purpose. However, these events in SHM occur infrequently and if happen, only last for a very short period of time. To effectively capture these short events using energy-limited wireless sensor nodes is a challenging task that has not been addressed in literature. In this paper, we propose a fast and reliable scheme to capture these short-term events. In terms of hardware, the radio-triggered unit and the vibration-triggered unit are designed in our motes. From software perspective, we develop the event capture scheme to realize fast, reliable and energy-efficient event detection under noisy environment. We mainly study the very first problem of the scheme: sentry selection. The optimization problem is formulated and we show that the problem is a general case of the classical k-center problem. Then we propose a greedy algorithm to solve this problem, and conduct simulation to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","1930-529X;1930-529X","978-1-4673-0921-9978-1-4673-0920-2978-1-4673-0919","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503182","","","condition monitoring;greedy algorithms;structural engineering;wireless sensor networks","event capture scheme;WSN;structural health monitoring;SHM;structural condition monitoring;damage detection;event detection;sentry selection;greedy algorithm","","","15","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The module employs the Ring-Array Concentrator (RAC), a novel point-focus optical design based on the concept of a Reflective Lens<sup>â¢</sup>(RL). RLs, which can also be referenced to as refractionless lenses, combine the high collecting power of mirrors with the design flexibility and rear-focus operation of lenses. The receiver of the module has passive cooling and incorporates a III-V PV cell and a bypass diode. A number of individual square-aperture modules are arranged into a densely packed planar array to form a rigid concentrator PV panel. The optical layout and general design of the module are presented. The optical performance of the RAC-PV module was modeled using a dedicated software system for simulation, calculation and optimization of RAC (RACsolver<sup>â¢</sup>). It is shown that a square-shaped focal spot corresponding to the most common shape of concentrator PV cells can be obtained while maintaining acceptable flux uniformity and avoiding secondary optics and associated losses. In order to maximize the acceptance angle, however, it is shown that certain low-loss focus improvers can be employed. We demonstrate that such focus improvers can be either reflective or refractive (with TIR) and they can also be low-profile, virtually lossless due to the minimum number of reflections and simultaneously serve as a cell encapsulant. We present and analyze the ray paths as well as flux maps in the receiver plane with and without focus improvers. The misalignment effects on the optical performance are also discussed. A prototype 3Ã2 mini-panel has been used to test the optical model. It is concluded that the current optical concept and proposed CPV module design allow for reducing the optical losses at the targeted high and uniform concentrations as well as can result in a panel-like appearance of the product being developed.","0160-8371;0160-8371","978-1-4244-5892-9978-1-4244-5890-5978-1-4244-5891","10.1109/PVSC.2010.5614474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5614474","","Optical reflection;Optical receivers;Lenses;Optical refraction;Optical design","photovoltaic power systems;solar absorber-convertors","planar concentrator PV panel;flat plate solar panel;ring array concentrator;reflective lens;rear focus operation;passive cooling;bypass diode;optical loss;CPV module design","","1","8","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method evaluates the effect of FES by comparing the ankle-angles of movements with and without FES. The change of the ankle-angles is one of the significant characteristics of the recovery of drop-foot. Therefore, this measurement method evaluates FES-assisted walking quantitatively through biomechanical properties of human gait. A group of subjects were asked to walk in the laboratory. Their walking performance was recorded by Vicon motion capture system. For each subject, a static trial and six walking trials were recorded. The data were sent to computer to establish the 3D model by Vicon Nexus software to calculate the ankle-angles of the drop-foot. The changes of the ankle-angles are obvious in the graphs. Statistical data analysis procedure for hypothesis testing was used to get a reliable result. Ankle-angles of movements were calculated to P values (P&lt;;0.05). The results show that FES is effective and the method is reliable. These clinical trial results suggest that using motion capture is a reliable and practicable way to evaluate hemiplegic drop-foot patients' dorsiflexion. This method will probably be used in carrying out a potential optimized stimulation intensity envelope for hemiplegic drop-foot stimulator. And the biomechanics of the ankle joint during the gait cycle also provide a way to the stroke patients to observe their recovery.","","978-1-4673-2127-3978-1-4673-2125-9978-1-4673-2126","10.1109/ROBIO.2012.6491071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6491071","","","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical optical imaging;diseases;gait analysis;legged locomotion;neuromuscular stimulation;patient rehabilitation;statistical analysis","ankle-angle analysis;drop-foot patients;FES;functional electrical stimulation;hemiplegic drop-foot;HDF;biomechanical properties;Vicon motion capture system;statistical data analysis","","1","21","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
